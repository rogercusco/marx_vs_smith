      "[u'\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn that rude state of society which precedes the extension of commerce and the improvement of manufactures, when those expensive luxuries which commerce and manufactures can alone introduce are altogether unknown, the person who possesses a large revenue, I have endeavoured to show in the third book of this Inquiry, can spend or enjoy that revenue in no other way than by maintaining nearly as many people as it can maintain. A large revenue may at all times be said to consist in the command of a large quantity of the necessaries of life. In that rude state of things it is commonly paid in a large quantity of those necessaries, in the materials of plain food and coarse clothing, in corn and cattle, in wool and raw hides. When neither commerce nor manufactures furnish anything for which the owner can exchange the greater part of those materials which are over and above his own consumption, he can do nothing with the surplus but feed and clothe nearly as many people as it will feed and clothe. A hospitality in which there is no luxury, and a liberality in which there is no ostentation, occasion, in this situation of things, the principal expences of the rich and the great. But these, I have likewise endeavoured to show in the same book, are expences by which people are not very apt to ruin themselves. There is not, perhaps, any selfish pleasure so frivolous of which the pursuit has not sometimes ruined even sensible men. A passion for cock-fighting has ruined many. But the instances, I believe, are not very numerous of people who have been ruined by a hospitality or liberality of this kind, though the hospitality of luxury and the liberality of ostentation have ruined many. Among our feudal ancestors, the long time during which estates used to continue in the same family sufficiently demonstrates the general disposition of people to live within their income. Though the rustic hospitality constantly exercised by the great land-holders may not, to us in the present times, seem consistent with that order which we are apt to consider as inseparably connected with good \\u0153conomy, yet we must certainly allow them to have been at least so far frugal as not commonly to have spent their whole income. A part of their wool and raw hides they had generally an opportunity of selling for money. Some part of this money, perhaps, they spent in purchasing the few objects of vanity and luxury with which the circumstances of the times could furnish them; but some part of it they seem commonly to have hoarded. They could not well, indeed, do anything else but hoard whatever money they saved. To trade was disgraceful to a gentleman, and to lend money at interest, which at that time was considered as usury and prohibited by law, would have been still more so. In those times of violence and disorder, besides, it was convenient to have a hoard of money at hand, that in case they should be driven from their own home they might have something of known value to carry with them to some place of safety. The same violence which made it convenient to hoard made it equally convenient to conceal the hoard. The frequency of treasure-trove, or of treasure found of which no owner was known, sufficiently demonstrates the frequency in those times both of hoarding and of concealing the board. Treasure-trove was then considered as an important branch of the revenue of the sovereign. All the treasure-trove of the kingdom would scarce perhaps in the present times make an important branch of the revenue of a private gentleman of a good estate.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same disposition to save and to hoard prevailed in the sovereign as well as in the subjects. Among nations to whom commerce and manufactures are little known, the sovereign, it has already been observed in the fourth book, is in a situation which naturally disposes him to the parsimony requisite for accumulation. In that situation the expence even of a sovereign cannot be directed by that vanity which delights in the gaudy finery of a court. The ignorance of the times affords but few of the trinkets in which that finery consists. Standing armies are not then necessary, so that the expence even of a sovereign, like that of any other great lord, can be employed in scarce anything but bounty to his tenants and hospitality to his retainers. But bounty and hospitality very seldom lead to extravagance; though vanity almost always does. All the ancient sovereigns of Europe accordingly, it has already been observed, had treasures. Every Tartar chief in the present times is said to have one.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a commercial country abounding with every sort of expensive luxury, the sovereign, in the same manner as almost all the great proprietors in his dominions, naturally spends a great part of his revenue in purchasing those luxuries. His own and the neighbouring countries supply him abundantly with all the costly trinkets which compose the splendid but insignificant pageantry of a court. For the sake of an inferior pageantry of the same kind, his nobles dismiss their retainers, make their tenants independent, and become gradually themselves as insignificant as the greater part of the wealthy burghers in his dominions. The same frivolous passions which influence their conduct influence his. How can it be supposed that he should be the only rich man in his dominions who is insensible to pleasures of this kind? If he does not, what he is very likely to do, spend upon those pleasures so great a part of his revenue as to debilitate very much the defensive power of the state, it cannot well be expected that he should not spend upon them all that part of it which is over and above what is necessary for supporting that defensive power. His ordinary expence becomes equal to his ordinary revenue, and it is well if it does not frequently exceed it. The amassing of treasure can no longer be expected, and when extraordinary exigencies require extraordinary expences, he must necessarily call upon his subjects for an extraordinary aid. The present and the late king of Prussia are the only great princes of Europe who, since the death of Henry IV of France in 1610, are supposed to have amassed any considerable treasure. The parsimony which leads to accumulation has become almost as rare in republican as in monarchical governments. The Italian republics, the United Provinces of the Netherlands, are all in debt. The canton of Berne is the single republic in Europe which has amassed any considerable treasure. The other Swiss republics have not. The taste for some sort of pageantry, for splendid buildings, at least, and other public ornaments, frequently prevails as much in the apparently sober senate-house of a little republic as in the dissipated court of the greatest king.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe want of parsimony in time of peace imposes the necessity of contracting debt in time of war. When war comes, there is no money in the treasury but what is necessary for carrying on the ordinary expence of the peace establishment. In war an establishment of three of four times that expence becomes necessary for the defence of the state, and consequently a revenue three or four times greater than the peace revenue. Supposing that the sovereign should have, what he scarce ever has, the immediate means of augmenting his revenue in proportion to the augmentation of his expence, yet still the produce of the taxes, from which this increase of revenue must be drawn, will not begin to come into the treasury till perhaps ten or twelve months after they are imposed. But the moment in which war begins, or rather the moment in which it appears likely to begin, the army must be augmented, the fleet must be fitted out, the garrisoned towns must be put into a posture of defence; that army, that fleet, those garrisoned towns must be furnished with arms, ammunition, and provisions. An immediate and great expence must be incurred in that moment of immediate danger, which will not wait for the gradual and slow returns of the new taxes. In this exigency government can have no other resource but in borrowing.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe same commercial state of society which, by the operation of moral causes, brings government in this manner into the necessity of borrowing, produces in the subjects both an ability and an inclination to lend. If it commonly brings along with it the necessity of borrowing, it likewise brings along with it the facility of doing so.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nA country abounding with merchants and manufacturers necessarily abounds with a set of people through whose hands not only their own capitals, but the capitals of all those who either lend them money, or trust them with goods, pass as frequently, or more frequently, than the revenue of a private man, who, without trade or business, lives upon his income, passes through his hands. The revenue of such a man can regularly pass through his hands only once in a year. But the whole amount of the capital and credit of a merchant, who deals in a trade of which the returns are very quick, may sometimes pass through his hands two, three, or four times a year. A country abounding with merchants and manufacturers, therefore, necessarily abounds with a set of people who have it at all times in their power to advance, if they choose to do so, a very large sum of money to government. Hence the ability in the subjects of a commercial state to lend.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nCommerce and manufactures can seldom flourish long in any state which does not enjoy a regular administration of justice, in which the people do not feel themselves secure in the possession of their property, in which the faith of contracts is not supported by law, and in which the authority of the state is not supposed to be regularly employed in enforcing the payment of debts from all those who are able to pay. Commerce and manufactures, in short, can seldom flourish in any state in which there is not a certain degree of confidence in the justice of government. The same confidence which disposes great merchants and manufacturers, upon ordinary occasions, to trust their property to the protection of a particular government, disposes them, upon extraordinary occasions, to trust that government with the use of their property. By lending money to government, they do not even for a moment diminish their ability to carry on their trade and manufactures. On the contrary, they commonly augment it. The necessities of the state render government upon most occasions willing to borrow upon terms extremely advantageous to the lender. The security which it grants to the original creditor is made transferable to any other creditor, and, from the universal confidence in the justice of the state, generally sells in the market for more than was originally paid for it. The merchant or monied man makes money by lending money to government, and instead of diminishing, increases his trading capital. He generally considers it as a favour, therefore, when the administration admits him to a share in the first subscription for a new loan. Hence the inclination or willingness in the subjects of a commercial state to lend.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe government of such a state is very apt to repose itself upon this ability and willingness of its subjects to lend it their money on extraordinary occasions. It foresees the facility of borrowing, and therefore dispenses itself from the duty of saving.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a rude state of society there are no great mercantile or manufacturing capitals. The individuals who hoard whatever money they can save, and who conceal their hoard, do so from a distrust of the justice of government, from a fear that if it was known that they had a hoard, and where that hoard was to be found, they would quickly be plundered. In such a state of things few people would be able, and nobody would be willing, to lend their money to government on extraordinary exigencies. The sovereign feels that he must provide for such exigencies by saving because he foresees the absolute impossibility of borrowing. This foresight increases still further his natural disposition to save.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe progress of the enormous debts which at present oppress, and will in the long-run probably ruin, all the great nations of Europe has been pretty uniform. Nations, like private men, have generally begun to borrow upon what may be called personal credit, without assigning or mortgaging any particular fund for the payment of the debt; and when this resource has failed them, they have gone on to borrow upon assignments or mortgages of particular funds.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u\"\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is called the unfunded debt of Great Britain is contracted in the former of those two ways. It consists partly in a debt which bears, or is supposed to bear, no interest, and which resembles the debts that a private man contracts upon account, and partly in a debt which bears interest, and which resembles what a private man contracts upon his bill or promissory note. The debts which are due either for extraordinary services, or for services either not provided for, or not paid at the time when they are performed, part of the extrordinaries of the army, navy, and ordnance, the arrears of subsidies to foreign princes, those of seamen's wages, &c. usually constitute a debt of the first kind, sometimes in payment of a part of such Navy and exchequer bills, which are issued sometimes in payment of a part of such debts and sometimes for other purposes, constitute a debt of the second kind\\u2014exchequer bills bearing interest from the day on which they are issued, and navy bills six months after they are issued. The Bank of England, either by voluntarily discounting those bills at their current value, or by agreeing with government for certain considerations to circulate exchequer bills, that is, to receive them at par, paying the interest which happens to be due upon them, keeps up their value and facilitates their circulation, and thereby frequently enables government to contract a very large debt of this kind. In France, where there is no bank, the state bills (billets d'etat) have sometimes sold at sixty and seventy per cent. discount. During the great recoinage in King William's time, when the Bank of England thought proper to put a stop to its usual transactions, exchequer bills and tallies are said to have sold from twenty-five to sixty per cent. discount; owing partly, no doubt, to the supposed instability of the new government established by the Revolution, but partly, too, to the want of the support of the Bank of England.\\r\\n\\r\\n\", u'\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this resource is exhausted, and it becomes necessary, in order to raise money, to assign or mortgage some particular branch of the public revenue for the payment of the debt, government has upon different occasions done this in two different ways. Sometimes it has made this assignment or mortgage for a short period of time only, a year, or a few years, for example; and sometimes for perpetuity. In the one case the fund was supposed sufficient to pay, within the limited time, both principal and interest of the money borrowed. In the other it was supposed sufficient to pay the interest only, or a perpetual annuity equivalent to the interest, government being at liberty to redeem at any time this annuity upon paying back the principal sum borrowed. When money was raised in the one way, it was said to be raised by anticipation; when in the other, by perpetual funding, or, more shortly, by funding.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Great Britain the land and malt taxes are regularly anticipated every year, by virtue of a borrowing clause constantly inserted into the acts which impose them. The Bank of England generally advances at an interest, which since the Revolution has varied from eight to three per cent, the sums for which those taxes are granted, and receives payment as their produce gradually comes in. If there is a deficiency, which there always is, it is provided for in the supplies of the ensuing year. The only considerable branch of the public revenue which yet remains unmortgaged is thus regularly spent before it comes in. Like an improvident spendthrift, whose pressing occasions will not allow him to wait for the regular payment of his revenue, the state is in the constant practice of borrowing of its own factors and agents, and of paying interest for the use of its own money.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the reign of King William, and during a great part of that of Queen Anne, before we had become so familiar as we are now with the practice of perpetual funding, the greater part of the new taxes were imposed but for a short period of time (for four, five, six, or seven years only), and a great part of the grants of every year consisted in loans upon anticipations of the produce of those taxes. The produce being frequently insufficient for paying within the limited term the principal and interest of the money borrowed, deficiencies arose, to make good which it became necessary to prolong the term.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1697, by the 8th of William III., c. 20, the deficiencies of several taxes were charged upon what was then called the first general mortgage or fund, consisting of a prolongation to the first of August 1706 of several different taxes which would have expired within a shorter term, and of which the produce was accumulated into one general fund. The deficiencies charged upon this prolonged term amounted to 5,160,459l. 14s. 9\\xbcd.\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1701, those duties, with some others, were still further prolonged for the like purposes till the first of August 1710, and were called the second general mortgage or fund. The deficiencies charged upon it amounted to 2,055,999l. 7s. 11\\xbdd.\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1707, those duties were still further prolonged, as a fund for new loans, to the first of August 1712, and were called the third general mortgage or fund. The sum borrowed upon it was 983,254l. 11s. 9\\xbcd.\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1708, those duties were all (except the Old Subsidy of Tonnage and Poundage, of which one moiety only was made a part of this fund, and a duty upon the importation of Scotch linen, which had been taken off by the Articles of Union) still further continued, as a fund for new loans, to the first of August 1714, and were called the fourth general mortgage or fund. The sum borrowed upon it was 925,176l. 9s. 2\\xbcd.\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1709, those cities were all (except the Old Subsidy of Tonnage and Poundage, which was now left out of this fund altogether) still further continued for the same purpose to the first of August 1716, and were called the fifth general mortgage or fund. The sum borrowed upon it was 922,029l. 6s.\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1710, those duties were again prolonged to the first of August 1720, and were called the sixth general mortgage or fund. The sum borrowed upon it was 1,296,552l. 9s. 11\\xbed.\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1711, the same duties (which at this time were thus subject to four different anticipations) together with several others were continued for ever, and made a fund for paying the interest of the capital of the South Sea Company, which had that year advanced to government, for paying debts and making good deficiencies, the sum of 9,177,967l. 15s. 4d.; the greatest loan which at that time had ever been made.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore this period, the principal, so far as I have been able to observe, the only taxes which in order to pay the interest of a debt had been imposed for perpetuity, were those for paying the interest of the money which had been advanced to government by the Bank and the East India Company, and of what it was expected would be advanced, but which was never advanced, by a projected land bank. The bank fund at this time amounted to 3,375,027l. 17s. 10\\xbdd., for which was paid an annuity or interest of 206,501l. 13s. 5d. The East India fund amounted to 3,200,000l., for which was paid an annuity or interest of 160,000l.\\u2014the bank fund being at six per cent, the East India fund at five per cent. interest.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1715, by the 1st of George I., c. 12, the different taxes which had been mortgaged for paying the bank annuity, together with several others which by this act were likewise rendered perpetual, were accumulated into one common fund called The Aggregate Fund, which was charged not only with the payments of the bank annuity, but with several other annuities and burdens of different kinds. This fund was afterwards augmented by the 3rd of George I., c. 8, and by the 5th of George I., c. 3, and the different duties which were then added to it were likewise rendered perpetual.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 1717, by the 3rd of George I., c. 7, several other taxes were rendered perpetual, and accumulated into another common fund, called The General Fund, for the payment of certain annuities, amounting in the whole to 724,849l. 6s. 10\\xbdd.\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn consequence of those different acts, the greater part of the taxes which before had been anticipated only for a short term of years were rendered perpetual as a fund for paying, not the capital, but the interest only, of the money which had been borrowed upon them by different successive anticipations.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nHad money never been raised but by anticipation, the course of a few years would have liberated the public revenue without any other attention of government besides that of not overloading the fund by charging it with more debt than it could pay within the limited term, and of not anticipating a second time before the expiration of the first anticipation. But the greater part of European governments have been incapable of those attentions. They have frequently overloaded the fund even upon the first anticipation, and when this happened not to be the case, they have generally taken care to overload it by anticipating a second and a third time before the expiration of the first anticipation. The fund becoming in this manner altogether insufficient for paying both principal and interest of the money borrowed upon it, it became necessary to charge it with the interest only, or a perpetual annuity equal to the interest, and such unprovident anticipations necessarily gave birth to the more ruinous practice of perpetual funding. But though this practice necessarily puts off the liberation of the public revenue from a fixed period to one so indefinite that it is not very likely ever to arrive, yet as a greater sum can in all cases be raised by this new practice than by the old one of anticipations, the former, when men have once become familiar with it, has in the great exigencies of the state been universally preferred to the latter. To relieve the present exigency is always the object which principally interests those immediately concerned in the administration of public affairs. The future liberation of the public revenue they leave to the care of posterity.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the reign of Queen Anne, the market rate of interest had fallen from six to five per cent, and in the twelfth year of her reign five per cent. was declared to be the highest rate which could lawfully be taken for money borrowed upon private security. Soon after the greater part of the temporary taxes of Great Britain had been rendered perpetual, and distributed into the Aggregate, South Sea, and General Funds, the creditors of the public, like those of private persons, were induced to accept of five per cent. for the interest of their money, which occasioned a saving of one per cent. upon the capital of the greater part of the debts which had been thus funded for perpetuity, or of one-sixth of the greater part of the annuities which were paid out of the three great funds above mentioned. This saving left a considerable surplus in the produce of the different taxes which had been accumulated into those funds over and above what was necessary for paying the annuities which were now charged upon them, and laid the foundation of what has since been called the Sinking Fund. In 1717, it amounted to 323,434l. 7s. 7\\xbdd. In 1727, the interest of the greater part of the public debts was still further reduced to four per cent; and in 1753 and 1757, to three and a half and three per cent; which reductions still further augmented the sinking fund.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nA sinking fund, though instituted for the payment of old, facilitates very much the contracting of new debts. It is a subsidiary fund always at hand to be mortgaged in aid of any other doubtful fund upon which money is proposed to be raised in an exigency of the state. Whether the sinking fund of Great Britain has been more frequently applied to the one or to the other of those two purposes will sufficiently appear by and by.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nBesides those two methods of borrowing, by anticipations and by perpetual funding, there are two other methods which hold a sort of middle place between them. These are, that of borrowing upon annuities for terms of years, and that of borrowing upon annuities for lives.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the reigns of King William and Queen Anne, large sums were frequently borrowed upon annuities for terms of years, which were sometimes longer and sometimes shorter. In 1693, an act was passed for borrowing one million upon an annuity of fourteen per cent, or of 140,000l. a year for sixteen years. In 1691, an act was passed for borrowing a million upon annuities for lives, upon terms which in the present times would appear very advantageous. But the subscription was not filled up. In the following year the deficiency was made good by borrowing upon annuities for lives at fourteen per cent, or at little more than seven years purchase. In 1695, the persons who had purchased those annuities were allowed to exchange them for others of ninety-six years upon paying into the Exchequer sixty-three pounds in the hundred; that is, the difference between fourteen per cent. for life, and fourteen per cent. for ninety-six years, was sold for sixty-three pounds, or for four and a half years purchase. Such was the supposed instability of government that even these terms procured few purchasers. In the reign of Queen Anne money was upon different occasions borrowed both upon annuities for lives, and upon annuities for terms of thirty-two, of eighty-nine, of ninety-eight, and of ninety-nine years. In 1719, the proprietors of the annuities for thirty-two years were induced to accept in lieu of them South Sea stock to the amount of eleven and a half years purchase of the annuities, together with an additional quantity of stock equal to the arrears which happened then to be due upon them. In 1720, the greater part of the other annuities for terms of years both long and short were subscribed into the same fund. The long annuities at that time amounted to 666,821l. 8s. 3\\xbdd. a year. On the 5th of January 1775, the remainder of them, or what was not subscribed at that time, amounted only to 136,453l. 12s. 8d.\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the two wars which began in 1739 and in 1755, little money was borrowed either upon annuities for terms of years, or upon those for lives. An annuity for ninety-eight or ninety-nine years, however, is worth nearly as much money as a perpetuity, and should, therefore, one might think, be a fund for borrowing nearly as much. But those who, in order to make family settlements, and to provide for remote futurity, buy into the public stocks, would not care to purchase into one of which the value was continually diminishing; and such people make a very considerable proportion both of the proprietors and purchasers of stock. An annuity for a long term of years, therefore, though its intrinsic value may be very nearly the same with that of a perpetual annuity, will not find nearly the same number of purchasers. The subscribers to a new loan, who mean generally to sell their subscriptions as soon as possible, prefer greatly a perpetual annuity redeemable by Parliament to an irredeemable annuity for a long term of years of only equal amount. The value of the former may be supposed always the same, or very nearly the same, and it makes, therefore, a more convenient transferable stock than the latter.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the two last-mentioned wars, annuities, either for terms of years or for lives, were seldom granted but as premiums to the subscribers to a new loan over and above the redeemable annuity or interest upon the credit of which the loan was supposed to be made. They were granted, not as the proper fund upon which the money was borrowed, but as an additional encouragement to the lender.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nAnnuities for lives have occasionally been granted in two different ways; either upon separate lives, or upon lots of lives, which in French are called Tontines, from the name of their inventor. When annuities are granted upon separate lives, the death of every individual annuitant disburthens the public revenue so far as it was affected by his annuity. When annuities are granted upon tontines, the liberation of the public revenue does not commence till the death of all annuitants comprehended in one lot, which may sometimes consist of twenty or thirty persons, of whom the survivors succeed to the annuities of all those who die before them, the last survivor succeeding to the annuities of the whole lot. Upon the same revenue more money can always be raised by tontines than by annuities for separate lives. An annuity, with a right of survivorship, is really worth more than an equal annuity for a separate life, and from the confidence which every man naturally has in his own good fortune, the principle upon which is founded the success of all lotteries, such an annuity generally sells for something more than it is worth. In countries where it is usual for government to raise money by granting annuities, tontines are upon this account generally preferred to annuities for separate lives. The expedient which will raise most money is almost always preferred to that which is likely to bring about in the speediest manner the liberation of the public revenue.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn France a much greater proportion of the public debts consists in annuities for lives than in England. According to a memoir presented by the Parliament of Bordeaux to the king in 1764, the whole public debt of France is estimated at twenty-four hundred millions of livres, of which the capital for which annuities for lives had been granted is supposed to amount to three hundred millions, the eighth part of the whole public debt. The annuities themselves are computed to amount to thirty millions a year, the fourth part of one hundred and twenty millions, the supposed interest of that whole debt. These estimations, I know very well, are not exact, but having been presented by so very respectable a body as approximations to the truth, they may, I apprehend, be considered as such. It is not the different degrees of anxiety in the two governments of France and England for the liberation of the public revenue which occasions this difference in their respective modes of borrowing. It arises altogether from the different views and interests of the lenders.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn England, the seat of government being in the greatest mercantile city in the world, the merchants are generally the people who advance money to government. By advancing it they do not mean to diminish, but, on the contrary, to increase their mercantile capitals, and unless they expected to sell with some profit their share in the subscription for a new loan, they never would subscribe. But if by advancing their money they were to purchase, instead of perpetual annuities, annuities for lives only, whether their own or those of other people, they would not always be so likely to sell them with a profit. Annuities upon their own lives they would always sell with loss, because no man will give for an annuity upon the life of another, whose age and state of health are nearly the same with his own, the same price which he would give for one upon his own. An annuity upon the life of a third person, indeed, is, no doubt, of equal value to the buyer and the seller; but its real value begins to diminish from the moment it is granted, and continues to do so more and more as long as it subsists. It can never, therefore, make so convenient a transferable stock as a perpetual annuity, of which the real value may be supposed always the same, or very nearly the same.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn France, the seat of government not being in a great mercantile city, merchants do not make so great a proportion of the people who advance money to government. The people concerned in the finances, the farmers general, the receivers of the taxes which are not in farm, the court bankers, &c. make the greater part of those who advance their money in all public exigencies. Such people are commonly men of mean birth, but of great wealth, and frequently of great pride. They are too proud to marry their equals, and women of quality disdain to marry them. They frequently resolve, therefore, to live bachelors, and having neither any families of their own, nor much regard for those of their relations, whom they are not always very fond of acknowledging, they desire only to live in splendour during their own time, and are not unwilling that their fortune should end with themselves. The number of rich people, besides, who are either averse to marry, or whose condition of life renders it either improper or inconvenient for them to do so, is much greater in France than in England. To such people, who have little or no care for posterity, nothing can be more convenient than to exchange their capital for a revenue which is to last just as long, and no longer, than they wish it to do.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ordinary expence of the greater part of modern governments in time of peace being equal or nearly equal to their ordinary revenue, when war comes they are both unwilling and unable to increase their revenue in proportion to the increase of their expence. They are unwilling for fear of offending the people, who, by so great and so sudden an increase of taxes, would soon be disgusted with the war; and they are unable from not well knowing what taxes would be sufficient to produce the revenue wanted. The facility of borrowing delivers them from the embarrassment which this fear and inability would otherwise occasion. By means of borrowing they are enabled, with a very moderate increase of taxes, to raise, from year to year, money sufficient for carrying on the war, and by the practice of perpetually funding they are enabled, with the smallest possible increase of taxes, to raise annually the largest possible sum of money. In great empires the people who live in the capital, and in the provinces remote from the scene of action, feel, many of them, scarce any inconveniency from the war; but enjoy, at their ease, the amusement of reading in the newspapers the exploits of their own fleets and armies. To them this amusement compensates the small difference between the taxes which they pay on account of the war, and those which they had been accustomed to pay in time of peace. They are commonly dissatisfied with the return of peace, which puts an end to their amusement, and to a thousand visionary hopes of conquest and national glory from a longer continuance of the war.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe return of peace, indeed, seldom relieves them from the greater part of the taxes imposed during the war. These are mortgaged for the interest of the debt contracted in order to carry it on. If, over and above paying the interest of this debt, and defraying the ordinary expence of government, the old revenue, together with the new taxes, produce some surplus revenue, it may perhaps be converted into a sinking fund for paying off the debt. But, in the first place, this sinking fund, even supposing it should be applied to no other purpose, is generally altogether inadequate for paying, in the course of any period during which it can reasonably be expected that peace should continue, the whole debt contracted during the war; and, in the second place, this fund is almost always applied to other purposes.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new taxes were imposed for the sole purpose of paying the interest of the money borrowed upon them. If they produce more, it is generally something which was neither intended nor expected, and is therefore seldom very considerable. Sinking funds have generally arisen not so much from any surplus of the taxes which was over and above what was necessary for paying the interest or annuity originally charged upon them, as from a subsequent reduction of that interest. That of Holland in 1655, and that of the ecclesiastical state in 1685, were both formed in this manner. Hence the usual insufficiency of such funds.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the most profound peace various events occur which require an extraordinary expence, and government finds it always more convenient to defray this expence by misapplying the sinking fund than by imposing a new tax. Every new tax is immediately felt more or less by the people. It occasions always some murmur, and meets with some opposition. The more taxes may have been multiplied, the higher they may have been raised upon every different subject of taxation; the more loudly the people complain of every new tax, the more difficult it becomes, too, either to find out new subjects of taxation, or to raise much higher the taxes already imposed upon the old. A momentary suspension of the payment of debt is not immediately felt by the people, and occasions neither murmur nor complaint. To borrow of the sinking fund is always an obvious and easy expedient for getting out of the present difficulty. The more the public debts may have been accumulated, the more necessary it may have become to study to reduce them, the more dangerous, the more ruinous it may be to misapply any part of the sinking fund; the less likely is the public debt to be reduced to any considerable degree, the more likely, the more certainly is the sinking fund to be misapplied towards defraying all the extraordinary expences which occur in time of peace. When a nation is already overburdened with taxes, nothing but the necessities of a new war, nothing but either the animosity of national vengeance, or the anxiety for national security, can induce the people to submit, with tolerable patience, to a new tax. Hence the usual misapplication of the sinking fund.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Great Britain, from the time that we had first recourse to the ruinous expedient of perpetual funding, the reduction of the public debt in time of peace has never borne any proportion to its accumulation in time of war. It was in the war which began in 1688, and was concluded by the Treaty of Ryswick in 1697, that the foundation of the present enormous debt of Great Britain was first laid.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 31st of December 1697, the public debts of Great Britain, funded and unfunded, amounted to 21,515,742l. 13s. 8\\xbdd. A great part of those debts had been contracted upon short anticipations, and some part upon annuities for lives, so that before the 31st of December 1701, in less than four years, there had partly been paid off, and partly reverted to the public, the sum of 5,121,041l. 12s. 0\\xbed.; a greater reduction of the public debt than has ever since been brought about in so short a period of time. The remaining debt, therefore, amounted only to 16,394,701l. 1s. 7\\xbcd.\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the war which began in 1702, and which was concluded by the Treaty of Utrecht, the public debts were still more accumulated. On the 31st of December 1714, they amounted to 53,681,076l. 5s. 6\\xbdd. The subscription into the South Sea fund of the short and long annuities increased the capital of the public debts, so that on the 31st of December 1722 it amounted to 55,282,978l. 1s. 3 5/6d. The reduction of the debt began in 1723, and went on so slowly that, on the 31st of December 1739, during seventeen years of profound peace, the whole sum paid off was no more than 8,328,354l. 17s. 11 3/12d., the capital of the public debt at that time amounting to 46,954,623l. 3s. 4 7/12d.\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Spanish war, which began in 1739, and the French war which soon followed it occasioned further increase of the debt, which, on the 31st of December 1748, after the war had been concluded by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, amounted to 78,293,313l. 1s. 10\\xbed. The most profound peace of seventeen years continuance had taken no more than 8,328,354l. 17s. 11 3/12d. from it. A war of less than nine years continuance added 31,338,689l. 18s. 6 1/6d. to it.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nDuring the administration of Mr. Pelham, the interest of the public debt was reduced, or at least measures were taken for reducing it, from four to three per cent; the sinking fund was increased, and some part of the public debt was paid off. In 1755, before the breaking out of the late war, the funded debt of Great Britain amounted to 72,289,673l. On the 5th of January 1763, at the conclusion of the peace, the funded debt amounted to 122,603,336l. 8s. 2\\xbcd. The unfunded debt has been stated at 13,927,589l. 2s. 2d. But the expence occasioned by the war did not end with the conclusion of the peace, so that though, on the 5th of January 1764, the funded debt was increased (partly by a new loan, and partly by funding a part of the unfunded debt) to 129,586,789l. 10s. 1\\xbed., there still remained (according to the very well informed author of the Considerations on the Trade and Finances of Great Britain) an unfunded debt which was brought to account in that and the following year of 9,975,017l. 12s. 2 15/44d. In 1764, therefore, the public debt of Great Britain, funded and unfunded together, amounted, according to this author, to 139,516,807l. 2s. 4d. The annuities for lives, too, which had been granted as premiums to the subscribers to the new loans in 1757, estimated at fourteen years purchase, were valued at 472,500l.; and the annuities for long terms of years, granted as premiums likewise in 1761 and 1762, estimated at twenty-seven and a half years purchase, were valued at 6,826,875l. During a peace of about seven years continuance, the prudent and truly patriot administration of Mr. Pelham was not able to pay off an old debt of six millions. During a war of nearly the same continuance, a new debt of more than seventy-five millions was contracted.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nOn the 5th of January 1775, the funded debt of Great Britain amounted to 124,996,086l. 1s. 6\\xbcd. The unfunded, exclusive of a large civil list debt, to 4,150,263l. 3s. 11 7/8d. Both together, to 129,146,322l. 5s. 6d. According to this account the whole debt paid off during eleven years profound peace amounted only to 10,415,474l. 16s. 9 7/8d. Even this small reduction of debt, however, has not been all made from the savings out of the ordinary revenue of the state. Several extraneous sums, altogether independent of that ordinary revenue, have contributed towards it. Amongst these we may reckon an additional shilling in the pound land-tax for three years; the two millions received from the East India Company as indemnification for their territorial acquisitions; and the one hundred and ten thousand pounds received from the bank for the renewal of their charter. To these must be added several other sums which, as they arose out of the late war, ought perhaps to be considered as deductions from the expences of it. The principal are,\\r\\n\\r\\n', u\"\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we add to this sum the balance of the Earl of Chatham's and Mr. Calcraft's accounts, and other army savings of the same kind, together with what has been received from the bank, the East India Company, and the additional shilling in the pound land-tax, the whole must be a good deal more than five millions. The debt, therefore, which since the peace has been paid out of the savings the ordinary revenue of the state, has not, one year with another, amounted to half a million a year. The sinking fund has, no doubt, been considerably augmented since the peace, by the debt which has been paid off, by the reduction of the redeemable four per cents to three per cents, and by the annuities for lives which have fallen in, and, if peace were to continue, a million, perhaps, might now be annually spared out of it towards the discharge of the debt. Another million, accordingly, was paid in the course of last year; but, at the same time, a new civil list debt was left unpaid, and we are now involved in a new war which, in its progress, may prove as expensive as any of our former wars.* The new debt which will probably be contracted before the end of the next campaign may perhaps be nearly equal to all the old debt which has been paid off from the savings out of the ordinary revenue of the state. It would be altogether chimerical, therefore, to expect that the public debt should ever be completely discharged by any savings which are likely to be made from that ordinary revenue as it stands at present.    * It has proved more expensive than all of our former wars; and has involved us in an additional debt of more than one hundred millions. During a profound peace of eleven years, little more than ten millions of debt was paid; during a war of seven years, more than one hundred millions was contracted.\\r\\n\\r\\n\", u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe public funds of the different indebted nations of Europe, particularly those of England, have by one author been represented as the accumulation of a great capital superadded to the other capital of the country, by means of which its trade is extended, its manufactures multiplied, and its lands cultivated and improved much beyond what they could have been by means of that other capital only. He does not consider that the capital which the first creditors of the public advanced to government was, from the moment in which they advanced it, a certain portion of the annual produce turned away from serving in the function of a capital to serve in that of a revenue; from maintaining productive labourers to maintain unproductive ones, and to be spent and wasted, generally in the course of the year, without even the hope of any future reproduction. In return for the capital which they advanced they obtained, indeed, an annuity in the public funds in most cases of more than equal value. This annuity, no doubt, replaced to them their capital, and enabled them to carry on their trade and business to the same or perhaps to a greater extent than before; that is, they were enabled either to borrow of other people a new capital upon the credit of this annuity, or by selling it to get from other people a new capital of their own equal or superior to that which they had advanced to government. This new capital, however, which they in this manner either bought or borrowed of other people, must have existed in the country before, and must have been employed, as all capitals are, in maintaining productive labour. When it came into the hands of those who had advanced their money to government, though it was in some respects a new capital to them, it was not so to the country, but was only a capital withdrawn from certain employments in or to be turned towards others. Though it replaced to them what they had advanced to government, it did not replace it to the country. Had they not advanced this capital to government, there would have been in the country two capitals, two portions of the annual produce, instead of one, employed in maintaining productive labour.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen for defraying the expence of government a revenue is raised within the year from the produce of free or unmortgaged taxes, a certain portion of the revenue of private people is only turned away from maintaining one species of unproductive labour towards maintaining another. Some part of what they pay in those taxes might no doubt have been accumulated into capital, and consequently employed in maintaining productive labour; but the greater part would probably have been spent and consequently employed in maintaining unproductive labour. The public expence, however, when defrayed in this manner, no doubt hinders more or less the further accumulation of new capital; but it does not necessarily occasion the destruction of any actually existing capital.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the public expence is defrayed by funding, it is defrayed by the annual destruction of some capital which had before existed in the country; by the perversion of some portion of the annual produce which had before been destined for the maintenance of productive labour towards that of unproductive labour. As in this case, however, the taxes are lighter than they would have been had a revenue sufficient for defraying the same expence been raised within the year, the private revenue of individuals is necessarily less burdened, and consequently their ability to save and accumulate some part of that revenue into capital is a good deal less impaired. If the method of funding destroys more old capital, it at the same time hinders less the accumulation or acquisition of new capital than that of defraying the public expence by a revenue raised within the year. Under the system of funding, the frugality and industry of private people can more easily repair the breaches which the waste and extravagance of government may occasionally make in the general capital of the society.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is only during the continuance of war, however, that the system of funding has this advantage over the other system. Were the expence of war to be defrayed always by a revenue raised within the year, the taxes from which that extraordinary revenue was drawn would last no longer than the war. The ability of private people to accumulate, though less during the war, would have been greater during the peace than under the system of funding. War would not necessarily have occasioned the destruction of any old capitals, and peace would have occasioned the accumulation of many more new. Wars would in general be more speedily concluded, and less wantonly undertaken. The people feeling, during the continuance of the war, the complete burden of it, would soon grow weary of it, and government, in order to humour them, would not be under the necessity of carrying it on longer than it was necessary to do so. The foresight of the heavy and unavoidable burdens of war would hinder the people from wantonly calling for it when there was no real or solid interest to fight for. The seasons during which the ability of private people to accumulate was somewhat impaired would occur more rarely, and be of shorter continuance. Those, on the contrary, during which the ability was in the highest vigour would be of much longer duration than they can well be under the system of funding.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen funding, besides, has made a certain progress, the multiplication of taxes which it brings along with it sometimes impairs as much the ability of private people to accumulate even in time of peace as the other system would in time of war. The peace revenue of Great Britain amounts at present to more than ten millions a year. If free and unmortgaged, it might be sufficient, with proper management and without contracting a shilling of new debt, to carry on the most vigorous war. The private revenue of the inhabitants of Great Britain is at present as much encumbered in time of peace, their ability to accumulate is as much impaired as it would have been in the time of the most expensive war had the pernicious system of funding never been adopted.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the payment of the interest of the public debt, it has been said, it is the right hand which pays the left. The money does not go out of the country. It is only a part of the revenue of one set of the inhabitants which is transferred to another, and the nation is not a farthing the poorer. This apology is founded altogether in the sophistry of the mercantile system, and after the long examination which I have already bestowed upon that system, it may perhaps be unnecessary to say anything further about it. It supposes, besides, that the whole public debt is owing to the inhabitants of the country, which happens not to be true; the Dutch, as well as several other foreign nations, having a very considerable share in our public funds. But though the whole debt were owing to the inhabitants of the country, it would not upon that account be less pernicious.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nLand and capital stock are the two original sources of all revenue both private and public. Capital stock pays the wages of productive labour, whether employed in agriculture, manufactures, or commerce. The management of those two original sources of revenue belong to two different sets of people; the proprietors of land, and the owners or employers of capital stock.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u\"\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proprietor of land is interested for the sake of his own revenue to keep his estate in as good condition as he can, by building and repairing his tenants' houses, by making and maintaining the necessary drains and enclosures, and all those other expensive improvements which it properly belongs to the landlord to make and maintain. But by different land-taxes the revenue of the landlord may be so much diminished, and by different duties upon the necessaries and conveniences of life that diminished revenue may be rendered of so little real value, that he may find himself altogether unable to make or maintain those expensive improvements. When the landlord, however, ceases to do his part, it is altogether impossible that the tenant should continue to do his. As the distress of the landlord increases, the agriculture of the country must necessarily decline.\\r\\n\\r\\n\", u'\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen, by different taxes upon the necessaries and conveniences of life, the owners and employers of capital stock find that whatever revenue they derive from it will not, in a particular country, purchase the same quantity of those necessaries and conveniences which an equal revenue would in almost any other, they will be disposed to remove to some other. And when, in order to raise those taxes, all or the greater part of merchants and manufacturers, that is, all or the greater part of the employers of great capitals, come to be continually exposed to the mortifying and vexatious visits of the tax-gatherers, the disposition to remove will soon be changed into an actual removal. The industry of the country will necessarily fall with the removal of the capital which supported it, and the ruin of trade and manufactures will follow the declension of agriculture.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nTo transfer from the owners of those two great sources of revenue, land and capital stock, from the persons immediately interested in the good condition of every particular portion of land, and in the good management of every particular portion of capital stock, to another set of persons (the creditors of the public, who have no such particular interest), the greater part of the revenue arising from either must, in the long-run, occasion both the neglect of land, and the waste or removal of capital stock. A creditor of the public has no doubt a general interest in the prosperity of the agriculture, manufactures, and commerce of the country, and consequently in the good condition of its lands, and in the good management of its capital stock. Should there be any general failure or declension in any of these things, the produce of the different taxes might no longer be sufficient to pay him the annuity or interest which is due to him. But a creditor of the public, considered merely as such, has no interest in the good condition of any particular portion of land, or in the good management of any particular portion of capital stock. As a creditor of the public he has no knowledge of any such particular portion. He has no inspection of it. He can have no care about it. Its ruin may in some cases be unknown to him, and cannot directly affect him.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe practice of funding has gradually enfeebled every state which has adopted it. The Italian republics seem to have begun it. Genoa and Venice, the only two remaining which can pretend to an independent existence, have both been enfeebled by it. Spain seems to have learned the practice from the Italian republics, and (its taxes being probably less judicious than theirs) it has, in proportion to its natural strength, been still more enfeebled. The debts of Spain are of very old standing. It was deeply in debt before the end of the sixteenth century, about a hundred years before England owed a shilling. France, notwithstanding all its natural resources, languishes under an oppressive load of the same kind. The republic of the United Provinces is as much enfeebled by its debts as either Genoa or Venice. Is it likely that in Great Britain alone a practice which has brought either weakness or desolation into every other country should prove altogether innocent?\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe system of taxation established in those different countries, it may be said, is inferior to that of England. I believe it is so. But it ought to be remembered that, when the wisest government has exhausted all the proper subjects of taxation, it must, in cases of urgent necessity, have recourse to improper ones. The wise republic of Holland has upon some occasions been obliged to have recourse to taxes as inconvenient as the greater part of those of Spain. Another war begun before any considerable liberation of the public revenue had been brought about, and growing in its progress as expensive as the last war, may, from irresistible necessity, render the British system of taxation as oppressive as that of Holland, or even as that of Spain. To the honour of our present system of taxation, indeed, it has hitherto given so little embarrassment to industry that, during the course even of the most expensive wars, the frugality and good conduct of individuals seem to have been able, by saving and accumulation, to repair all the breaches which the waste and extravagance of government had made in the general capital of the society. At the conclusion of the late war, the most expensive that Great Britain ever waged, her agriculture was as flourishing, her manufacturers as numerous and as fully employed, and her commerce as extensive as they had ever been before. The capital, therefore, which supported all those different branches of industry must have been equal to what it had ever been before. Since the peace, agriculture has been still further improved, the rents of houses have risen in every town and village of the country\\u2014a proof of the increasing wealth and revenue of the people; and the annual amount the greater part of the old taxes, of the principal branches of the excise and customs in particular, has been continually increasing\\u2014an equally clear proof of an increasing consumption, and consequently of an increasing produce which could alone support that consumption. Great Britain seems to support with ease a burden which, half a century ago, nobody believed her capable of supporting. Let us not, however, upon this account rashly conclude that she is capable of supporting any burden, nor even be too confident that she could support, without great distress, a burden a little greater than what has already been laid upon her.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen national debts have once been accumulated to a certain degree, there is scarce, I believe, a single instance of their having been fairly and completely paid. The liberation of the public revenue, if it has ever been brought about by bankruptcy; sometimes by an avowed one, but always by a real one, though frequently by a pretended payment.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe raising of the denomination of the coin has been the most usual expedient by which a real public bankruptcy has been disguised under the appearance of a pretended payment. If a sixpence, for example, should either by Act of Parliament or Royal Proclamation be raised to the denomination of a shilling, and twenty sixpences to that of a pound sterling, the person who under the old denomination had borrowed twenty shillings, or near four ounces of silver, would, under the new, pay with twenty sixpences, or with something less than two ounces. A national debt of about a hundred and twenty-eight millions, nearly the capital of the funded and unfunded debt of Great Britain, might in this manner be paid with about sixty-four millions of our present money. It would indeed be a pretended payment only, and the creditors of the public would really be defrauded of ten shillings in the pound of what was due to them. The calamity, too, would extend much further than to the creditors of the public, and those of every private person would suffer a proportionable loss; and this without any advantage, but in most cases with a great additional loss, to the creditors of the public. If the creditors of the public, indeed, were generally much in debt to other people, they might in some measure compensate their loss by paying their creditors in the same coin in which the public had paid them. But in most countries the creditors of the public are, the greater part of them, wealthy people, who stand more in the relation of creditors than in that of debtors towards the rest of their fellow-citizens. A pretended payment of this kind, therefore, instead of alleviating, aggravates in most cases the loss of the creditors of the public, and without any advantage to the public, extends the calamity to a great number of other innocent people. It occasions a general and most pernicious subversion of the fortunes of private people, enriching in most cases the idle and profuse debtor at the expence of the industrious and frugal creditor, and transporting a great part of the national capital from the hands which were likely to increase and improve it to those which are likely to dissipate and destroy it. When it becomes necessary for a state to declare itself bankrupt, in the same manner as when it becomes necessary for an individual to do so, a fair, open, and avowed bankruptcy is always the measure which is both least dishonourable to the debtor and least hurtful to the creditor. The honour of a state is surely very poorly provided for when, in order to cover the disgrace of a real bankruptcy, it has recourse to a juggling trick of this kind, so easily seen through, and at the same time so extremely pernicious.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nAlmost all states, however, ancient as well as modern, when reduced to this necessity have, upon some occasions, played this very juggling trick. The Romans, at the end of the first Punic war, reduced the As, the coin or denomination by which they computed the value of all their other coins, from containing twelve ounces of copper to contain only two ounces; that is, they raised two ounces of copper to a denomination which had always before expressed the value of twelve ounces. The republic was, in this manner, enabled to pay the great debts which it had contracted with the sixth part of what it really owed. So sudden and so great a bankruptcy, we should in the present times be apt to imagine, must have occasioned a very violent popular clamour. It does not appear to have occasioned any. The law which enacted it was, like all other laws relating to the coin, introduced and carried through the assembly of the people by a tribune, and was probably a very popular law. In Rome, as in all the other ancient republics, the poor people were constantly in debt to the rich and the great, who in order to secure their votes at the annual elections, used to lend them money at exorbitant interest, which, being never paid, soon accumulated into a sum too great either for the debtor to pay, or for anybody else to pay for him. The debtor, for fear of a very severe execution, was obliged, without any further gratuity, to vote for the candidate whom the creditor recommended. In spite of all the laws against bribery and corruption, the bounty of the candidates, together with the occasional distributions of corn which were ordered by the senate, were the principal funds from which, during the latter times of the Roman republic, the poorer citizens derived their subsistence. To deliver themselves from this subjection to their creditors, the poorer citizens were continually calling out either for an entire abolition of debts, or for what they called New Tables; that is, for a law which should entitle them to a complete acquittance upon paying only a certain proportion of their accumulated debts. The law which reduced the coin of all denominations to a sixth part of its former value, as it enabled them to pay their debts with a sixth part of what they really owed, was equivalent to the most advantageous New Tables. In order to satisfy the people, the rich and the great were, upon several different occasions, obliged to consent to laws both for abolishing debts, and for introducing New Tables; and they probably were induced to consent to this law partly for the same reason, and partly that, by liberating the public revenue, they might restore vigour to that government of which they themselves had the principal direction. An operation of this kind would at once reduce a debt of a hundred and twenty-eight millions to twenty-one millions three hundred and thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-three pounds six shillings and eightpence. In the course of the second Punic war the As was still further reduced, first, from two ounces of copper to one ounce, and afterwards from one ounce to half an ounce; that is, to the twenty-fourth part of its original value. By combining the three Roman operations into one, a debt of a hundred and twenty-eight millions of our present money might in this manner be reduced all at once to a debt of five millions three hundred and thirty-three thousand three hundred and thirty-three pounds six shillings and eightpence. Even the enormous debts of Great Britain might in this manner soon be paid.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nBy means of such expedients the coin of, I believe, all nations has been gradually reduced more and more below its original value, and the same nominal sum has been gradually brought to contain a smaller and a smaller quantity of silver.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nNations have sometimes, for the same purpose, adulterated the standard of their coin; that is, have mixed a greater quantity of alloy in it. If in the pound weight of our silver coin, for example, instead of eighteen pennyweight, according to the present standard, there was mixed eight ounces of alloy, a pound sterling, or twenty shillings of such coin, would be worth little more than six shillings and eightpence of our present money. The quantity of silver contained in six shillings and eightpence of our present money would thus be raised very nearly to the denomination of a pound sterling. The adulteration of the standard has exactly the same effect with what the French call an augmentation, or a direct raising of the denomination of the coin.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nAn augmentation, or a direct raising of the coin, always is, and from its nature must be, an open and avowed operation. By means of it pieces of a smaller weight and bulk are called by the same name which had before been given to pieces of a greater weight and bulk. The adulteration of the standard, on the contrary, has generally been a concealed operation. By means of it pieces were issued from the mint of the same denominations, and, as nearly as could be contrived, of the same weight, bulk, and appearance with pieces which had been current before of much greater value. When King John of France, in order to pay his debts, adulterated his coin, all the officers of his mint were sworn to secrecy. Both operations are unjust. But a simple augmentation is an injustice of open violence, whereas the adulteration is an injustice of treacherous fraud. This latter operation, therefore, as soon as it has been discovered, and it could never be concealed very long, has always excited much greater indignation than the former. The coin after any considerable augmentation has very seldom been brought back to its former weight; but after the greater adulterations it has almost always been brought back to its former fineness. It has scarce ever happened that the fury and indignation of the people could otherwise be appeased.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the end of the reign of Henry VIII. and in the beginning of that of Edward VI. the English coin was not only raised in its denomination, but adulterated in its standard. The like frauds were practised in Scotland during the minority of James VI. They have occasionally been practised in most other countries.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThat the public revenue of Great Britain can never be completely liberated, or even that any considerable progress can ever be made towards that liberation, while the surplus of that revenue, or what is over and above defraying the annual expence of the peace establishment, is so very small, it seems altogether in vain to expect. That liberation, it is evident, can never be brought about without either some very considerable augmentation of the public revenue, or some equally considerable reduction of the public expence.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nA more equal land-tax, a more equal tax upon the rent of houses, and such alterations in the present system of customs and excise as those which have been mentioned in the foregoing chapter might, perhaps, without increasing the burden of the greater part of the people, but only distributing the weight of it more equally upon the whole, produce a considerable augmentation of revenue. The most sanguine projector, however, could scarce flatter himself that any augmentation of this kind would be such as could give any reasonable hopes either of liberating the public revenue altogether, or even of making such progress towards that liberation in time of peace as either to prevent or to compensate the further accumulation of the public debt in the next war.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nBy extending the British system of taxation to all the different provinces of the empire inhabited by people of either British or European extraction, a much greater augmentation of revenue might be expected. This, however, could scarce, perhaps, be done, consistently with the principles of the British constitution, without admitting into the British Parliament, or if you will into the states general of the British empire, a fair and equal representation of all those different provinces, that of each province bearing the same proportion to the produce of its taxes as the representation of Great Britain might bear to the produce of the taxes levied upon Great Britain. The private interest of many powerful individuals, the confirmed prejudices of great bodies of people seem, indeed, at present, to oppose to so great a change such obstacles as it may be very difficult, perhaps altogether impossible, to surmount. Without, however, pretending to determine whether such a union be practicable or impracticable, it may not, perhaps, be improper, in a speculative work of this kind, to consider how far the British system of taxation might be applicable to all the different provinces of the empire, what revenue might be expected from it if so applied, and in what manner a general union of this kind might be likely to affect the happiness and prosperity of the different provinces comprehended within it. Such a speculation can at worst be regarded but as a new Utopia, less amusing certainly, but not more useless and chimerical than the old one.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe land-tax, the stamp-duties, and the different duties of customs and excise constitute the four principal branches of the British taxes.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIreland is certainly as able, and our American and West Indian plantations more able to pay a land-tax than Great Britain. Where the landlord is subject neither to tithe nor poor-rate, he must certainly be more able to pay such a tax than where he is subject to both those other burdens. The tithe, where there is no modus, and where it is levied in kind, diminishes more what would otherwise be the rent of the landlord than a land-tax which really amounted to five shillings in the pound. Such a tithe will be found in most cases to amount to more than a fourth part of the real rent of the land, or of what remains after replacing completely the capital of the farmer, together with his reasonable profit. If all moduses and all impropriations were taken away, the complete church tithe of Great Britain and Ireland could not well be estimated at less than six or seven millions. If there was no tithe either in Great Britain or Ireland, the landlords could afford to pay six or seven millions additional land-tax without being more burdened than a very great part of them are at present. America pays no tithe, and could therefore very well afford to pay a land-tax. The lands in America and the West Indies, indeed, are in general not tenanted nor leased out to farmers. They could not therefore be assessed according to any rent-roll. But neither were the lands of Great Britain, in the 4th of William and Mary, assessed according to any rent-roll, but according to a very loose and inaccurate estimation. The lands in America might be assessed either in the same manner, or according to an equitable valuation in consequence of an accurate survey like that which was lately made in the Milanese, and in the dominions of Austria, Prussia, and Sardinia.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nStamp-duties, it is evident, might be levied without any variation in all countries where the forms of law process, and the deeds by which property both real and personal is transferred, are the same or nearly the same.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe extension of the custom-house laws of Great Britain to Ireland and the plantations, provided it was accompanied, as in justice it ought to be, with an extension of the freedom of trade, would be in the highest degree advantageous to both. All the invidious restraints which at present oppress the trade of Ireland, the distinction between the enumerated and non-enumerated commodities of America, would be entirely at an end. The countries north of Cape Finisterre would be as open to every part of the produce of America as those south of that Cape are to some parts of that produce at present. The trade between all the different parts of the British empire would, in consequence of this uniformity in the custom-house laws, be as free as the coasting trade of Great Britain is at present. The British empire would thus afford within itself an immense internal market for every part of the produce of all its different provinces. So great an extension of market would soon compensate both to Ireland and the plantations all that they could suffer from the increase of the duties of customs.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe excise is the only part of the British system of taxation which would require to be varied in any respect according as it was applied to the different provinces of the empire. It might be applied to Ireland without any variation, the produce and consumption of that kingdom being exactly of the same nature with those of Great Britain. In its application to America and the West Indies, of which the produce and consumption are so very different from those of Great Britain, some modification might be necessary in the same manner as in its application to the cyder and beer counties of England.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nA fermented liquor, for example, which is called beer, but which, as it is made of molasses, bears very little resemblance to our beer, makes a considerable part of the common drink of the people in America. This liquor, as it can be kept only for a few days, cannot, like our beer, be prepared and stored up for sale in great breweries; but every private family must brew it for their own use, in the same manner as they cook their victuals. But to subject every private family to the odious visits and examination of the tax-gatherers, in the same manner as we subject the keepers of alehouses and the brewers for public sale, would be altogether inconsistent with liberty. If for the sake of equality it was thought necessary to lay a tax upon this liquor, it might be taxed by taxing the material of which it is made, either at the place of manufacture, or, if the circumstances of the trade rendered such an excise improper, by laying a duty upon its importation into the colony in which it was to be consumed. Besides the duty of one penny a gallon imposed by the British Parliament upon the importation of molasses into America, there is a provincial tax of this kind upon their importation into Massachusetts Bay, in ships belonging to any other colony, of eightpence the hogshead; and another upon their importation, from the northern colonies into South Carolina, of fivepence the gallon. Or if neither of these methods was found convenient, each family might compound for its consumption of this liquor, either according to the number of persons of which it consisted, in the same manner as private families compound for the malt-tax in England; or according to the different ages and sexes of those persons, in the same manner as several different taxes are levied in Holland; or nearly as Sir Matthew Decker proposes that all taxes upon consumable commodities should be levied in England. This mode of taxation, it has already been observed, when applied to objects of a speedy consumption is not a very convenient one. It might be adopted, however, in cases where no better could be done.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nSugar, rum, and tobacco are commodities which are nowhere necessaries of life, which are become objects of almost universal consumption, and which are therefore extremely proper subjects of taxation. If a union with the colonies were to take place, those commodities might be taxed either before they go out of the hands of the manufacturer or grower, or if this mode of taxation did not suit the circumstances of those persons, they might be deposited in public warehouses both at the place of manufacture, and at all the different ports of the empire to which they might afterwards be transported, to remain there, under the joint custody of the owner and the revenue officer, till such time as they should be delivered out either to the consumer, to the merchant retailer for home consumption, or to the merchant exporter, the tax not to be advanced till such delivery. When delivered out for exportation, to go duty free upon proper security being given that they should really be exported out of the empire. These are perhaps the principal commodities with regard to which a union with the colonies might require some considerable change in the present system of British taxation.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat might be the amount of the revenue which this system of taxation extended to all the different provinces of the empire might produce, it must, no doubt, be altogether impossible to ascertain with tolerable exactness. By means of this system there is annually levied in Great Britain, upon less than eight millions of people, more than ten millions of revenue. Ireland contains more than two millions of people, and according to the accounts laid before the congress, the twelve associated provinces of America contain more than three. Those accounts, however, may have been exaggerated, in order, perhaps, either to encourage their own people, or to intimidate those of this country, and we shall suppose, therefore, that our North American and West Indian colonies taken together contain no more than three millions; or that the whole British empire, in Europe and America, contains no more than thirteen millions of inhabitants. If upon less than eight millions of inhabitants this system of taxation raises a revenue of more than ten millions sterling, it ought upon thirteen millions of inhabitants to raise a revenue of more than sixteen millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling. From this revenue, supposing that this system could produce it, must be deducted the revenue usually raised in Ireland and the plantations for defraying the expence of their respective civil governments. The expence of the civil and military establishment of Ireland, together with the interest of the public debt, amounts, at a medium of the two years which ended March 1775, to something less than seven hundred and fifty thousand pounds a year. By a very exact account of the revenue of the principal colonies of America and the West Indies, it amounted, before the commencement of the present disturbances, to a hundred and forty-one thousand eight hundred pounds. In this account, however, the revenue of Maryland, of North Carolina, and of all our late acquisitions both upon the continent and in the islands is omitted, which may perhaps make a difference of thirty or forty thousand pounds. For the sake of even numbers, therefore, let us suppose that the revenue necessary for supporting the civil government of Ireland and the plantations may amount to a million. There would remain consequently a revenue of fifteen millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds to be applied towards defraying the general expence of the empire, and towards paying the public debt. But if from the present revenue of Great Britain a million could in peaceable times be spared towards the payment of that debt, six millions two hundred and fifty thousand pounds could very well be spared from this improved revenue. This great sinking fund, too, might be augmented every year by the interest of the debt which had been discharged the year before, and might in this manner increase so very rapidly as to be sufficient in a few years to discharge the whole debt, and thus to restore completely the at present debilitated and languishing vigour of the empire. In the meantime the people might be relieved from some of the most burdensome taxes; from those which are imposed either upon the necessaries of life, or upon the materials of manufacture. The labouring poor would thus be enabled to live better, to work cheaper, and to send their goods cheaper to market. The cheapness of their goods would increase the demand for them, and consequently for the labour of those who produced them. This increase in the demand for labour would both increase the numbers and improve the circumstances of the labouring poor. Their consumption would increase, and together with it the revenue arising from all those articles of their consumption upon which the taxes might be allowed to remain.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe revenue arising from this system of taxation, however, might not immediately increase in proportion to the number of people who were subjected to it. Great indulgence would for some time be due to those provinces of the empire which were thus subjected to burdens to which they had not before been accustomed, and even when the same taxes came to be levied everywhere as exactly as possible, they would not everywhere produce a revenue proportioned to the numbers of the people. In a poor country the consumption of the principal commodities subject to the duties of customs and excise is very small, and in a thinly inhabited country the opportunities of smuggling are very great. The consumption of malt liquors among the inferior ranks of people in Scotland is very small, and the excise upon malt, beer, and ale produces less there than in England in proportion to the numbers of the people and the rate of the duties, which upon malt is different on account of a supposed difference of quality. In these particular branches of the excise there is not, I apprehend, much more smuggling in the one country than in the other. The duties upon the distillery, and the greater part of the duties of customs, in proportion to the numbers of people in the respective countries, produce less in Scotland than in England, not only on account of the smaller consumption of the taxed commodities, but of the much greater facility of smuggling. In Ireland the inferior ranks of people are still poorer than in Scotland, and many parts of the country are almost as thinly inhabited. In Ireland, therefore, the consumption of the taxed commodities might, in proportion to the number of the people, be still less than Scotland, and the facility of smuggling nearly the same. In America and the West Indies the white people even of the lowest rank are in much better circumstances than those of the same rank in England, and their consumption of all the luxuries in which they usually indulge themselves is probably much greater. The blacks, indeed, who make the greater part of the inhabitants both of the southern colonies upon the continent and of the West India islands, as they are in a state of slavery, are, no doubt, in a worse condition than the poorest people either in Scotland or Ireland. We must not, however, upon that account, imagine that they are worse fed, or that their consumption of articles which might be subjected to moderate duties is less than that even of the lower ranks of people in England. In order that they may work well, it is the interest of their master that they should be fed well and kept in good heart in the same manner as it is his interest that his working cattle should be so. The blacks accordingly have almost everywhere their allowance of rum and molasses or spruce beer in the same manner as the white servants, and this allowance would not probably be withdrawn though those articles should be subjected to moderate duties. The consumption of the taxed commodities, therefore, in proportion to the number of inhabitants, would probably be as great in America and the West Indies as in any part of the British empire. The opportunities of smuggling, indeed, would be much greater; America, in proportion to the extent of the country, being much more thinly inhabited than either Scotland or Ireland. If the revenue, however, which is at present raised by the different duties upon malt and malt liquors were to be levied by a single duty upon malt, the opportunity of smuggling in the most important branch of the excise would be almost entirely taken away: and if the duties of customs, instead of being imposed upon almost all the different articles of importation, were confined to a few of the most general use and consumption, and if the levying of those duties were subjected to the excise laws, the opportunity of smuggling, though not so entirely taken away, would be very much diminished. In consequence of those two, apparently, very simple and easy alterations, the duties of customs and excise might probably produce a revenue as great in proportion to the consumption of the most thinly inhabited province as they do at present in proportion to that of the most populous.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Americans, it has been said, indeed, have no gold or silver money; the interior commerce of the country being carried on by a paper currency, and the gold and silver which occasionally come among them being all sent to Great Britain in return for the commodities which they receive from us. But without gold and silver, it is added, there is no possibility of paying taxes. We already get all the gold and silver which they have. How is it possible to draw from them what they have not?\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe present scarcity of gold and silver money in America is not the effect of the poverty of that country, or of the inability of the people there to purchase those metals. In a country where the wages of labour are so much higher, and the price of provisions so much lower than in England, the greater part of the people must surely have wherewithal to purchase a greater quantity if it were either necessary or convenient for them to do so. The scarcity of those metals, therefore, must be the effect of choice, and not of necessity.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is for transacting either domestic or foreign business that gold and silver money is either necessary or convenient.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe domestic business of every country, it has been shown in the second book of this Inquiry, may, at least in peaceable times, be transacted by means of a paper currency with nearly the same degree of conveniency as by gold and silver money. It is convenient for the Americans, who could always employ with profit in the improvement of their lands a greater stock than they can easily get, to save as much as possible the expence of so costly an instrument of commerce as gold and silver, and rather to employ that part of their surplus produce which would be necessary for purchasing those metals in purchasing the instruments of trade, the materials of clothing, several parts of household furniture, and the ironwork necessary for building and extending their settlements and plantations; in purchasing, not dead stock, but active and productive stock. The colony governments find it for their interest to supply the people with such a quantity of papermoney as is fully sufficient and generally more than sufficient for transacting their domestic business. Some of those governments, that of Pennsylvania particularly, derive a revenue from lending this paper-money to their subjects at an interest of so much per cent. Others, like that of Massachusetts Bay, advance upon extraordinary emergencies a paper-money of this kind for defraying the public expence, and afterwards, when it suits the conveniency of the colony, redeem it at the depreciated value to which it gradually falls. In 1747, that colony paid, in this manner, the greater part of its public debts with the tenth part of the money for which its bills had been granted. It suits the conveniency of the planters to save the expence of employing gold and silver money in their domestic transactions, and it suits the conveniency of the colony governments to supply them with a medium which, though attended with some very considerable disadvantages, enables them to save that expence. The redundancy of paper-money necessarily banishes gold and silver from the domestic transactions of the colonies, for the same reason that it has banished those metals from the greater part of the domestic transactions in Scotland; and in both countries it is not the poverty, but the enterprising and projecting spirit of the people, their desire of employing all the stock which they can get as active and productive stock, which has occasioned this redundancy of paper-money.   In the exterior commerce which the different colonies carry on with Great Britain, gold and silver are more or less employed exactly in proportion as they are more or less necessary. Where those metals are not necessary they seldom appear. Where they are necessary they are generally found.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the commerce between Great Britain and the tobacco colonies the British goods are generally advanced to the colonists at a pretty long credit, and are afterwards paid for in tobacco, rated at a certain price. It is more convenient for the colonists to pay in tobacco than in gold and silver. It would be more convenient for any merchant to pay for the goods which his correspondents had sold to him in some other sort of goods which he might happen to deal in than in money. Such a merchant would have no occasion to keep any part of his stock by him unemployed, and in ready money, for answering occasional demands. He could have, at all times, a larger quantity of goods in his shop or warehouse, and he could deal to a greater extent. But it seldom happens to be convenient for all the correspondents of a merchant to receive payment for the goods which they sell to him in goods of some other kind which he happens to deal in. The British merchants who trade to Virginia and Maryland happen to be a particular set of correspondents, to whom it is more convenient to receive payment for the goods which they sell to those colonies in tobacco than in gold and silver. They expect to make a profit by the sale of the tobacco. They could make none by that of the gold and silver. Gold and silver, therefore, very seldom appear in the commerce between Great Britain and the tobacco colonies. Maryland and Virginia have as little occasion for those metals in their foreign as in their domestic commerce. They are said, accordingly, to have less gold and silver money than any other colonies in America. They are reckoned, however, as thriving, and consequently as rich, as any of their neighbours.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the northern colonies, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, the four governments of New England, &c. the value of their own produce which they export to Great Britain is not equal to that of the manufactures which they import for their own use, and for that of some of the other colonies to which they are the carriers. A balance, therefore, must be paid to the mother country in gold and silver, and this balance they generally find.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the sugar colonies the value of the produce annually exported to Great Britain is much greater than that of all the goods imported from thence. If the sugar and rum annually sent to the mother country were paid for in those colonies, Great Britain would be obliged to send out every year a very large balance in money, and the trade to the West Indies would, by a certain species of politicians, be considered as extremely disadvantageous. But it so happens that many of the principal proprietors of the sugar plantations reside in Great Britain. Their rents are remitted to them in sugar and rum, the produce of their estates. The sugar and rum which the West India merchants purchase in those colonies upon their own account are not equal in value to the goods which they annually sell there. A balance, therefore, must necessarily be paid to them in gold and silver, and this balance, too, is generally found.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe difficulty and irregularity of payment from the different colonies to Great Britain have not been at all in proportion to the greatness or smallness of the balances which were respectively due from them. Payments have in general been more regular from the northern than from the tobacco colonies, though the former have generally paid a pretty large balance in money, while the latter have either paid no balance, or a much smaller one. The difficulty of getting payment from our different sugar colonies has been greater or less in proportion, not so much to the extent of the balances respectively due from them, as to the quantity of uncultivated land which they contained; that is, to the greater or smaller temptation which the planters have been under of overtrading, or of undertaking the settlement and plantation of greater quantities of waste land than suited the extent of their capitals. The returns from the great island of Jamaica, where there is still much uncultivated land, have, upon this account, been in general more irregular and uncertain than those from the smaller islands of Barbadoes, Antigua, and St. Christophers, which have for these many years been completely cultivated, and have, upon that account, afforded less field for the speculations of the planter. The new acquisitions of Grenada, Tobago, St. Vincents, and Dominica have opened a new field for speculations of this kind, and the returns from those islands have of late been as irregular and uncertain as those from the great island of Jamaica.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not, therefore, the poverty of the colonies which occasions, in the greater part of them, the present scarcity of gold and silver money. Their great demand for active and productive stock makes it convenient for them to have as little dead stock as possible, and disposes them upon that account to content themselves with a cheaper though less commodious instrument of commerce than gold and silver. They are thereby enabled to convert the value of that gold and silver into the instruments of trade, into the materials of clothing, into household furniture, and into the ironwork necessary for building and extending their settlements and plantations. In those branches of business which cannot be transacted without gold and silver money, it appears that they can always find the necessary quantity of those metals; and if they frequently do not find it, their failure is generally the effect, not of their necessary poverty, but of their unnecessary and excessive enterprise. It is not because they are poor that their payments are irregular and uncertain, but because they are too eager to become excessively rich. Though all that part of the produce of the colony taxes which was over and above what was necessary for defraying the expence of their own civil and military establishments were to be remitted to Great Britain in gold and silver, the colonies have abundantly wherewithal to purchase the requisite quantity of those metals. They would in this case be obliged, indeed, to exchange a part of their surplus produce, with which they now purchase active and productive stock, for dead stock. In transacting their domestic business they would be obliged to employ a costly instead of a cheap instrument of commerce, and the expence of purchasing this costly instrument might damp somewhat the vivacity and ardour of their excessive enterprise in the improvement of land. It might not, however, be necessary to remit any part of the American revenue in gold and silver. It might be remitted in bills drawn upon and accepted by particular merchants or companies in Great Britain to whom a part of the surplus produce of America had been consigned, who would pay into the treasury the American revenue in money, after having themselves received the value of it in goods; and the whole business might frequently be transacted without exporting a single ounce of gold or silver from America.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not contrary to justice that both Ireland and America should contribute towards the discharge of the public debt of Great Britain. That debt has been contracted in support of the government established by the Revolution, a government to which the Protestants of Ireland owe, not only the whole authority which they at present enjoy in their own country, but every security which they possess for their liberty, their property, and their religion; a government to which several of the colonies of America owe their present charters, and consequently their present constitution, and to which all the colonies of America owe the liberty, security, and property which they have ever since enjoyed. That public debt has been contracted in the defence, not of Great Britain alone, but of all the different provinces of the empire; the immense debt contracted in the late war in particular, and a great part of that contracted in the war before, were both properly contracted in defence of America.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nBy a union with Great Britain, Ireland would gain, besides the freedom of trade, other advantages much more important, and which would much more than compensate any increase of taxes that might accompany that union. By the union with England the middling and inferior ranks of people in Scotland gained a complete deliverance from the power of an aristocracy which had always before oppressed them. By a union with Great Britain the greater part of the people of all ranks in Ireland would gain an equally complete deliverance from a much more oppressive aristocracy; an aristocracy not founded, like that of Scotland, in the natural and respectable distinctions of birth and fortune, but in the most odious of all distinctions, those of religious and political prejudices; distinctions which, more than any other, animate both the insolence of the oppressors and the hatred and indignation of the oppressed, and which commonly render the inhabitants of the same country more hostile to one another than those of different countries ever are. Without a union with Great Britain the inhabitants of Ireland are not likely for many ages to consider themselves as one people.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nNo oppressive aristocracy has ever prevailed in the colonies. Even they, however, would, in point of happiness and tranquility, gain considerably by a union with Great Britain. It would, at least, deliver them from those rancorous and virulent factions which are inseparable from small democracies, and which have so frequently divided the affections of their people, and disturbed the tranquillity of their governments, in their form so nearly democratical. In the case of a total separation from Great Britain, which, unless prevented by a union of this kind, seems very likely to take place, those factions would be ten times more virulent than ever. Before the commencement of the present disturbances, the coercive power of the mother country had always been able to restrain those factions from breaking out into anything worse than gross brutality and insult. If that coercive power were entirely taken away, they would probably soon break out into open violence and bloodshed. In all great countries which are united under one uniform government, the spirit of party commonly prevails less in the remote provinces than in the centre of the empire. The distance of those provinces from the capital, from the principal seat of the great scramble of faction and ambition, makes them enter less into the views of any of the contending parties, and renders them more indifferent and impartial spectators of the conduct of all. The spirit of party prevails less in Scotland than in England. In the case of a union it would probably prevail less in Ireland than in Scotland, and the colonies would probably soon enjoy a degree of concord and unanimity at present unknown in any part of the British empire. Both Ireland and the colonies, indeed, would be subjected to heavier taxes than any which they at present pay. In consequence, however, of a diligent and faithful application of the public revenue towards the discharge of the national debt, the greater part of those taxes might not be of long continuance, and the public revenue of Great Britain might soon be reduced to what was necessary for maintaining a moderate peace establishment.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nThe territorial acquisitions of the East India Company, the undoubted right of the crown, that is, of the state and people of Great Britain, might be rendered another source of revenue more abundant, perhaps, than all those already mentioned. Those countries are represented as more fertile, more extensive, and, in proportion to their extent, much richer and more populous than Great Britain. In order to draw a great revenue from them, it would not probably be necessary to introduce any new system of taxation into countries which are already sufficiently and more than sufficiently taxed. It might, perhaps, be more proper to lighten than to aggravate the burden of those unfortunate countries, and to endeavour to draw a revenue from them, not by imposing new taxes, but by preventing the embezzlement and misapplication of the greater part of those which they already pay.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\r\\n\\r\\nIf it should be found impracticable for Great Britain to draw any considerable augmentation of revenue from any of the resources above mentioned, the only resource which can remain to her is a diminution of her expence. In the mode of collecting and in that of expending the public revenue, though in both there may be still room for improvement, Great Britain seems to be at least as \\u0153conomical as any of her neighbours. The military establishment which she maintains for her own defence in time of peace is more moderate than that of any European state which can pretend to rival her either in wealth or in power. None of those articles, therefore, seem to admit of any considerable reduction of expence. The expence of the peace establishment of the colonies was, before the commencement of the present disturbances, very considerable, and is an expence which may, and if no revenue can be drawn from them ought certainly to be saved altogether. This constant expence in time of peace, though very great, is insignificant in comparison with what the defence of the colonies has cost us in time of war. The last war, which was undertaken altogether on account of the colonies, cost Great Britain, it has already been observed, upwards of ninety millions. The Spanish war of 1739 was principally undertaken on their account, in which, and in the French war that was the consequence of it, Great Britain spent upwards of forty millions, a great part of which ought justly to be charged to the colonies. In those two wars the colonies cost Great Britain much more than double the sum which the national debt amounted to before the commencement of the first of them. Had it not been for those wars that debt might, and probably would by this time, have been completely paid; and had it not been for the colonies, the former of those wars might not, and the latter certainly would not have been undertaken. It was because the colonies were supposed to be provinces of the British empire that this expence was laid out upon them. But countries which contribute neither revenue nor military force towards the support of the empire cannot be considered as provinces. They may perhaps be considered as appendages, as a sort of splendid and showy equipage of the empire. But if the empire can no longer support the expence of keeping up this equipage, it ought certainly to lay it down; and if it cannot raise its revenue in proportion to its expence, it ought, at least, to accommodate its expence to its revenue. If the colonies, notwithstanding their refusal to submit to British taxes, are still to be considered as provinces of the British empire, their defence in some future war may cost Great Britain as great an expence as it ever has done in any former war. The rulers of Great Britain have, for more than a century past, amused the people with the imagination that they possessed a great empire on the west side of the Atlantic. This empire, however, has hitherto existed in imagination only. It has hitherto been, not an empire, but the project of an empire; not a gold mine, but the project of a gold mine; a project which has cost, which continues to cost, and which, if pursued in the same way as it has been hitherto, is likely to cost, immense expence, without being likely to bring any profit; for the effects of the monopoly of the colony trade, it has been shown, are, to the great body of the people, mere loss instead of profit. It is surely now time that our rulers should either realize this golden dream, in which they have been indulging themselves, perhaps, as well as the people, or that they should awake from it themselves, and endeavour to awaken the people. If the project cannot be completed, it ought to be given up. If any of the provinces of the British empire cannot be made to contribute towards the support of the whole empire, it is surely time that Great Britain should free herself from the expence of defending those provinces in time of war, and of supporting any part of their civil or military establishments in time of peace, and endeavour to accommodate her future views and designs to the real mediocrity of her circumstances.\\r\\n\\r\\n', u'\\n']\n"

the pose of a scientist I know because I often do it myself When I teach undergraduates I very consciously describe the field of economics as a science so no student would start the course thinking he was embarking on some squishy academic endeavor Our colleagues in the physics department across campus may find it amusing that we view them as close cousins but we are quick to remind anyone who will listen that economists formulate theories with mathematical precision collect huge data sets on individual and aggregate behavior and exploit the most sophisticated statistical techniques to reach empirical judgments that are free of bias and ideology or so we like to think \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 Having recently spent two years in Washington as an economic adviser at a time when the US economy was struggling to pull out of a recession I am reminded that the subfield of macroeconomics was born not as a science but more as a type of engineering God put macroeconomists on earth not to propose and test elegant theories but to solve practical problems The problems He gave us moreover were not modest in dimension The problem that gave birth to our field97the Great Depression of the 1930s97 was an economic downturn of unprecedented scale including incomes so depressed and unemployment so widespread that it is no exaggeration to say that the viability of the capitalist system was called in question \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 This essay offers a brief history of macroeconomics together with an evaluation of what we have learned My premise is that the field has evolved through the efforts of two types of macroeconomist97those who understand the field as a type of engineering and those who would like it to be more of a science Engineers are first and foremost problem solvers By contrast the goal of scientists is to understand how the world works The research emphasis of macroeconomists has varied over time between these two motives While the early macroeconomists were engineers trying to solve practical problems the macroeconomists of the past several decades have been more interested in developing analytic tools and establishing theoretical principles These tools and principles however have been slow to find their way into applications As the field of macroeconomics has evolved one recurrent theme is the interaction97sometimes productive and sometimes \\nf0fs24

claim to greater virtueuc0u8232 The story is also not one of deep thinkers and simpleminded plumbers Science professors are typically no better at solving engineering problems than engineering professors are at solving scientific problems In both fields cuttingedge problems are hard problems as well as intellectually challenging ones \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 Just as the world needs both scientists and engineers it needs macroeconomists of both mindsets But I believe that the discipline would advance more smoothly and fruitfully if macroeconomists always kept in mind that their field

93macroeconomics94 first appears in the scholarly literature in the 1940s To be sure the topics of macroeconomics97inflation unemployment economic growth the business cycle and monetary and fiscal policy97have long intrigued economists In the eighteenth century for example David Hume 1752 wrote about the shortrun and longrun effects of monetary injections at many points his analysis looks remarkably similar to what one might see from a modern monetary economist or central banker In 1927 Arthur Pigou published a book titled \\nf0i Industrial Fluctuations \\nf1i0 that attempted to explain the business cycle Nonetheless the field of macroeconomics as a distinct and active area of inquiry arose in the shadow of the Great Depression There is nothing like a crisis to focus the mind \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 The Great Depression had a profound impact on those who lived through it In 1933 the US unemployment rate reached 25 percent and real GDP was 31 percent below its 1929 level All subsequent fluctuations in the US economy have been ripples on a calm sea compared to this tsunami Autobiographical essays by prominent economists of this era such as Lawrence Klein Franco Modigliani Paul Samuelson Robert Solow and James Tobin confirm that the Depression was a key motivating event in their careers Breit and Hirsch 2004 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 2 \\nf0fs24

developments All five of these Nobel laureates confirm this from firsthand experience Tobin reports the following reaction from Harvard where he was a student in the late 1930s and early 1940s 93The senior faculty was mostly hostileThe younger faculty and the graduate student teaching fellows were enthusiastic about Keynes92s book94 As is often the case the young had greater foresight than the old about the impact the new ideas Keynes tied with Marshall as the most frequently cited economist in economic journals in the 1930s and was the second most cited in the 1940s after Hicks Quandt 1976

\\n\\nf1fs32 When a modern economist reads \\nf0i The General Theory\\nf1i0  the experience is both exhilarating and frustrating On the one hand the book is the work of a great mind being applied to a social problem whose currency and enormity cannot be questioned On the other hand although the book is extensive in its analysis it somehow seems incomplete as a matter of logic Too many threads are left hanging The reader keeps asking what precisely is the economic model that ties together all the pieces \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 Soon after Keynes published \\nf0i The General Theory\\nf1i0  a generation of macroeconomists worked to answer this question by turning his grand vision into a simpler more concrete model One of the first and most influential attempt was the IS LM model proposed by the 33yearold John Hicks 1937 The 26yearold Franco Modigliani 1944 then extended and explained the model more fully To this day the \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 3 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 ISLM model remains the interpretation of Keynes offered in the most widely used intermediatelevel macroeconomics textbooks Some Keynesian critics of the ISLM model complain that it oversimplifies the economic vision offered by Keynes in \\nf0i The General Theory\\nf1i0  To some extent this may well be true The whole point of the model was to simplify a line of argument that was otherwise hard to follow The line between simplifying and oversimplifying is often far from clear \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 While theorists such as Hicks and Modigliani were developing Keynesian models suitable for the classroom blackboard econometricians such as Klein were working on more applied models that could be brought to the data and used for policy analysis Over time in the hope of becoming more realistic the models became larger and eventually included hundreds of variables and equations By the 1960s there were many competing models each based on the input of prominent Keynesians of the day such as the Wharton Model associated with Klein the DRI Data Resource Inc model associated with Otto Eckstein and the MPS MITPennSocial Science Research Council model associated with Albert Ando and Modigliani These models were widely used for forecasting and policy analysis The MPS model was maintained by the Federal Reserve for many years and would become the precursor to the FRBUS model which is still maintained and used by Fed staff \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 Although these models differed in detail their similarities were more striking than their differences They all had an essentially Keynesian structure In the back of each model builder92s mind was the same simple model taught to undergraduates today an IS curve relating financial conditions and fiscal policy to the components of GDP an LM curve that determined interest rates as the price that equilibrates the supply and demand for money and some kind of Phillips curve that describes how the price level responds over time to changes in the economy \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 As a matter of science \\nf0i The General Theory \\nf1i0 was a remarkable success The revolution that it inspired attracted many of the best young minds of its day Their prodigious output offered a new way to understand shortrun economic fluctuations Reflecting on these events Samuelson 1988 offered a succinct summary The Keynesian revolution was the most significant event in 20thcentury economic science This sentiment is shared by many economists of his generation \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 4 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 Yet the Keynesian revolution cannot be understood merely as a scientific advance To a large extent Keynes and the Keynesian model builders had the perspective of engineers They were motivated by problems in the real world and once they developed their theories they were eager to put them into practice Until his death in 1946 Keynes himself was heavily involved in offering policy advice So too were the early American Keynesians Tobin Solow and Eckstein all took time away from their academic pursuits during the 1960s to work at the Council of Economic Advisers The Kennedy tax cut eventually passed in 1964 was in many ways the direct result of the emerging Keynesian consensus and the models that embodied it \\nf0fs24 \\npardpardeftab720sl360sa240partightenfactor0\\n\\nbfs32 cf0 The New Classicals \\nb0fs24 \\npardpardeftab720sl360sa240partightenfactor0\\n\\nf1fs32 cf0 By the late 1960s cracks in the Keynesian consensus were starting to appear Those cracks would grow into fissures which would eventually crumble the macroeconomic consensus and undermine confidence in the mainstream econometric models In its place a more classical view of the economy would reemerge \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 The first wave of new classical economics was monetarism and its most notable proponent was Milton Friedman Friedman92s 1957 early work on the permanent income hypothesis was not directly about money or the business cycle but it certainly had implications for business cycle theory It was in part an attack on the Keynesian consumption function which provided the foundation for the fiscal policy multipliers that were central to Keynesian theory and policy prescriptions If the marginal propensity to consume out of transitory income is small as Friedman92s theory suggested then fiscal policy would have a much smaller impact on equilibrium income than many Keynesians believed \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 Friedman and Schwartz92s 1963 \\nf0i Monetary History of the United States \\nf1i0 was more directly concerned with the business cycle and it too undermined the Keynesian consensus Most Keynesians viewed the economy as inherently volatile constantly buffeted by the shifting 93animal spirits94 of investors Friedman and Schwartz suggested that economic instability should be traced not to private actors but rather to inept monetary policy The implication was that policymakers should be satisfied if they do no harm by following simple policy rules Although Friedman92s proposed rule of steady growth in monetary \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 5 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 aggregates has few adherents today it was an early precursor to the inflationtargeting regimes now in effect in many of the world92s central banks \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 Friedman92s Presidential Address to the American Economic Association in 1968 along with Phelps 1968 took aim at the weakest link in the Keynesian model the Phillips curve tradeoff between inflation and unemployment At least since Samuelson and Solow 1960 some sort of Phillips curve had been part of the Keynesian consensus even if not a view endorsed by Keynes himself Samuelson and Solow understood the theoretical tenuousness of this tradeoff and their paper was filled with caveats about why the shortrun and longrun tradeoff could differ But the subsequent literature forgot those caveats all too easily The Phillips curve provided a convenient way to complete the Keynesian model which always had trouble explaining why prices failed to equilibrate markets and how the price level adjusted over time \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 Friedman argued that the tradeoff between inflation and unemployment would not hold in the long run when classical principles should apply and money should be neutral The tradeoff appeared in the data because in the short run inflation is often unanticipated and unanticipated inflation can lower unemployment The particular mechanism that Friedman suggested was money illusion on the part of workers More important for the development of macroeconomics was that Friedman put expectations on center stage \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 This prepared the way for the second wave of new classical economics97the rational expectations revolution In a series of highly influential papers Robert Lucas extended Friedman92s argument In his 93Econometric Policy Evaluation A Critique94 Lucas 1976 argued that the mainstream Keynesian models were useless for policy analysis because they failed to take expectations seriously as a result the estimated empirical relationships that made up these models would break down if an alternative policy were implemented Lucas 1973 also proposed a business cycle theory based on the assumptions of imperfect information rational expectations and market clearing In this theory monetary policy matters only to the extent to which it surprises people and confuses them about relative prices Barro 1977 offered evidence that this model was consistent with US timeseries data Sargent and Wallace 1975 pointed out a key policy implication Because it is impossible to surprise rational people systematically systematic monetary policy aimed at stabilizing the economy is doomed to failure \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 6 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 The third wave of new classical economics was the real business cycle theories of Kydland and Prescott 1982 and Long and Plosser 1983 Like the theories of Friedman and Lucas these were built on the assumption that prices adjust instantly to clear markets97 a radical difference from Keynesian theorizing But unlike the new classical predecessors the real business cycle theories omitted any role of monetary policy unanticipated or otherwise in explaining economic fluctuations The emphasis switched to the role of random shocks to technology and the intertemporal substitution in consumption and leisure that these shocks induced \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 As a result of the three waves of new classical economics the field of macroeconomics became increasingly rigorous and increasingly tied to the tools of microeconomics The real business cycle models were specific dynamic examples of ArrowDebreu general equilibrium theory Indeed this was one of their main selling points Over time proponents of this work have backed away from the assumption that the business cycle is driven by real as opposed to monetary forces and they have begun to stress the methodological contributions of this work Today many macroeconomists coming from the new classical tradition are happy to concede to the Keynesian assumption of sticky prices as long as this assumption is imbedded in a suitably rigorous model in which economic actors are rational and forwardlooking Because of this change in emphasis the terminology has evolved and this class of work now often goes by the label 93dynamic stochastic general equilibrium94 theory But I am getting ahead of the story \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 At the time the three new classical waves were first hitting shore in the 1970s and 1980s one of their goals was to undermine the old Keynesian macroeconometric models both as a matter of science and as a matter of engineering In their article 93After Keynesian Macroeconomics94 Sargent and Lucas 1979 wrote 93For policy the central fact is that Keynesian policy recommendations have no sounder basis in a scientific sense than recommendations of nonKeynesian economists or for that matter noneconomists94 Although Sargent and Lucas thought Keynesian engineering was based on flawed science they knew that the new classical school circa 1979 did not yet have a model that was ready to bring to Washington 93We consider the best currently existing equilibrium models as prototypes of better future models which will we hope prove of practical use in the formulation of policy94 They also ventured that such models would be available 93in ten \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 7 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 years if we get lucky94 I will return later to the question of whether this prospect panned out as they had hoped \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 As these quotations suggest those engaged in the new classical movement were not shy about their intentions or modest about their accomplishments Lucas offered an even more blunt assessment in a 1980 article entitled 93The Death of Keynesian Economics94 93One cannot find good underforty economists who identify themselves or their work as 91Keynesian92 Indeed people even take offense if referred to as 91Keynesians92 At research seminars people don92t take Keynesian theorizing seriously anymore the audience starts to whisper and giggle to one another94 Yet just as Lucas was happily writing the eulogy for Keynesian economics the profession was about to welcome a generation of 93new Keynesians94 \\nf0fs24 \\npardpardeftab720sl360sa240partightenfactor0\\n\\nbfs32 cf0 The New Keynesians \\nb0fs24 \\npardpardeftab720sl360sa240partightenfactor0\\n\\nf1fs32 cf0 Economists attracted to the Keynesian approach to the business cycle have long been discomfited by the issue of microfoundations Indeed a 1946 article by Klein one of the first to use the term 93macroeconomics94 begins as follows 93Many of the newly constructed mathematical models of economic systems especially businesscycle theories are very loosely related to the behavior of individual households or firms which must form the basis of all theories of economic behavior94 All modern economists are to some degree classical We all teach our students about optimization equilibrium and market efficiency How to reconcile these two visions of the economy97one founded on Adam Smith92s invisible hand and Alfred Marshall92s supply and demand curves the other founded on Keynes92s analysis of an economy suffering from insufficient aggregate demand97has been a profound nagging question since macroeconomics began as a separate field of study \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 Early Keynesians such as Samuelson Modigliani and Tobin thought they had reconciled these visions in what is sometimes called the 93neoclassicalKeynesian synthesis94 These economists believed that the classical theory of Smith and Marshall was right in the long run but the invisible hand could become paralyzed in the short run described by Keynes The time horizon mattered because some prices97most notably the price of labor97adjusted sluggishly over time Early Keynesians believed that classical models \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 8 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 described the equilibrium toward which the economy gradually evolved but that Keynesian models offered the better description of the economy at any moment in time when prices were reasonably taken as predetermined \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 The neoclassicalKeynesian synthesis is coherent but it is also vague and incomplete While the new classical economists responded to these defects by rejecting the synthesis and starting afresh the new Keynesian economists thought there was much to preserve Their goal was to use the tools of microeconomics to give greater precision to the uneasy compromise reached by early Keynesians The neoclassicalKeynesian synthesis was like a house built in the 1940s The new classicals looked at its outdated systems and concluded it was a tear down while the new Keynesians admired the oldworld craftsmanship and embraced it as an opportunity for a major rehab \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 The first wave of research that can rightly be called 93new Keynesian94 is the work on general disequilibrium Barro and Grossman 1971 Malinvaud 1977 These theories aimed to use the tools of general equilibrium analysis to understand the allocation of resources that results when markets do not clear Wages and prices were taken as given The focus was on how the failure of one market to clear influences supply and demand in related markets According to these theories the economy can find itself in one of several regimes depending on which markets are experiencing excess supply and which are experiencing excess demand The most interesting regime97in the sense of corresponding best to what we observe during economic downturns97is the socalled Keynesian regime in which both the goods market and the labor market are exhibiting excess supply In the Keynesian regime unemployment arises because labor demand is too low to ensure full employment at prevailing wages the demand for labor is low because firms cannot sell all they want at prevailing prices and the demand for firms92 output is inadequate because many customers are unemployed Recessions and depressions result from a vicious circle of insufficient demand and a stimulus to demand can have multiplier effects \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 The second wave of new Keynesian research aimed to explore how the concept of rational expectations could be used in models without the assumption of market clearing To some extent this work was responding to Sargent and Wallace92s conclusion of monetary policy irrelevance by showing how systematic monetary policy could \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 9 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 potentially stabilize the economy despite rational expectations Fischer 1977 To some extent it was motivated by a desire find an empirically realistic model of inflation dynamics Taylor 1980 The Achilles heel of this work was that it assumed a form of labor contracts that while perhaps justifiable on empirical grounds was hard to square with microeconomic principles \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 Because so much of the Keynesian tradition was based on the premise that wages and prices fail to clear markets the third wave of new Keynesian research aimed to explain why this was the case Various hypotheses were explored that firms face 93menu costs94 when they choose to change their prices that firms pay their workers 93efficiency wages94 above the marketclearing level to increase worker productivity and that wage and price setters deviate from perfect rationality Mankiw 1985 and Akerlof and Yellen 1985 pointed out that when firms have market power there are large differences between the private and social costbenefit calculations regarding price adjustment so a stickyprice equilibrium could be privately rational or near rational while socially very costly Blanchard and Kiyotaki 1987 showed that part of this divergence between private and social incentives results from an aggregatedemand externality When one firm cuts its prices it increases real money balances and thus the demand for the products of all firms Ball and Romer 1990 established that there is strong complementary between real and nominal rigidities so any motive for avoiding relativeprice changes would exacerbate the sluggishness of nominal prices \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 In retrospect these various new Keynesian contributions were more related and complementary than they seemed at the time even to people working on them For example it is tempting to see the early work on general disequilibrium as a dead end97a research program that sowed the seeds of its own demise by its assumption of predetermined prices And indeed this work rarely finds its way on to reading lists today Yet one can also see a progression of related ideas about how the economy works when prices do not move instantly to balance supply and demand \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 There is for instance an interesting but rarely noticed relationship between the first and third waves of new Keynesian economics In particular one can view the third wave as establishing the centrality of the Keynesian regime highlighted in the first wave When firms have market power they charge prices above marginal cost so they always \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 10 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 want to sell more at prevailing prices In a sense if all firms have some degree of market power then goods markets are typically in a state of excess supply This theory of the goods market is often married to a theory of the labor market with aboveequilibrium wages such as the efficiencywage model In this case the Keynesian regime of generalized excess supply is not just one possible outcome for the economy but the typical one \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 In my judgment these three waves of new Keynesian research added up to a coherent microeconomic theory for the failure of the invisible hand to work for shortrun macroeconomic phenomena We understand how markets interact when there are price rigidities the role that expectations can play and the incentives that price setters face as they choose whether or not to change prices As a matter of science there was much success in this research although as a participant I cannot claim to be entirely objective The work was not revolutionary but it was not trying to be Instead it was counterrevolutionary Its aim was to defend the essence of the neoclassicalKeynesian synthesis from the new classical assault \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 Was this work also successful as a matter of engineering Did it help policymakers devise better policies to cope with the business cycle The judgment here must be less positive97a topic to which I will return shortly \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 But it is remarkable that the new Keynesians were by temperament more inclined to become macroeconomic engineers than were economists working within the new classical tradition Among the leaders of the new classical school none as far as I know has ever left academia to take a significant job in public policy By contrast the new Keynesian movement like the earlier generation of Keynesians was filled with people who would trade a few years in the ivory tower for a stay in the nation92s capital Examples include Stanley Fischer Larry Summers Joseph Stiglitz Janet Yellen John Taylor Richard Clarida Ben Bernanke and myself The first four of these economists came to Washington during the Clinton years the last four during the Bush years The division of economists between new classicals and new Keynesians is not fundamentally between the political right and the political left To a greater extent it is a split between pure scientists and economic engineers \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 11 \\nf0fs24 \\npardpardeftab720sl360sa240partightenfactor0\\n\\nbfs32 cf0 Digression and Vitriol \\nb0fs24 \\npardpardeftab720sl360sa240partightenfactor0\\n\\nf1fs32 cf0 The theory and empirics of longrun economic growth are beyond the scope of the essay but it is worth pointing out that these topics occupied much of the attention of macroeconomists during the decade of the 1990s This work drew attention away from shortrun fluctuations which had dominated the field of macroeconomics since its birth half a century earlier \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 There are several reasons for the emergence of growth as a major area for research First a series of influential papers by Paul Romer 1986 and others offered a new set of ideas and tools for analyzing what is surely one of the most compelling topics in economics97the large gap between rich and poor nations Second new crosscountry data became available that allowed systematic examination of the validity of alternative theories Summers and Heston 1991 Third the US economy in the 1990s was experiencing its longest expansion in history Just as the early Keynesians were attracted to the field because of its immediate relevance to the nation92s health the economy of the 1990s suggested to that generation of students that the business cycle was no longer of great practical importance \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 There is also a fourth more troublesome reason why budding macroeconomists of the 1990s were drawn to study longrun growth rather than shortrun fluctuations the tension between new classical and new Keynesian worldviews While Lucas the leading new classical economist was proclaiming that 93people don92t take Keynesian theorizing seriously anymore94 leading Keynesians were equally patronizing to their new classical colleagues In his AEA Presidential Address Solow 1980 called it 93foolishly restrictive94 for the new classical economists to rule out by assumption the existence of wage and price rigidities and the possibility that markets do not clear He said 93I remember reading once that it is still not understood how the giraffe manages to pump an adequate blood supply all the way up to its head but it is hard to imagine that anyone would therefore conclude that giraffes do not have long necks94 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 In an interview with Arjo Klamer 1984 a few years later Lucas remarked 93I dont think that Solow in particular has ever tried to come to grips with any of these issues except by making jokes94 In his own interview in the same volume Solow explained his unwillingness to engage with the new classical economists 93Suppose someone sits down where you are sitting right now and announces to me that he is \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 12 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 Napoleon Bonaparte The last thing I want to do with him is to get involved in a technical discussion of cavalry tactics at the Battle of Austerlitz If I do that Im getting tacitly drawn into the game that he is Napoleon Bonaparte94 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 To some extent this dispute reflects the differing perspectives of the protagonists about the goal of the field Lucas seems to be complaining that Solow does not appreciate the greater analytic rigor that new classical macroeconomics can offer Solow seems to be complaining the Lucas does not appreciate the patent lack of reality of his marketclearing assumptions They each have a point From the standpoint of science the greater rigor that the new classicals offered has much appeal But from the standpoint of engineering the cost of this added rigor seems too much to bear \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 I dwell on the nature of this debate not only because it reflects the underlying tension between scientists and engineers but also because it helps explain the choices made by the next generation of economists Such vitriol among intellectual giants attracts attention much in the way that the patrons in a bar gather around a fist fight egging on the participants But it was not healthy for the field of macroeconomics Not surprisingly many young economists chose to avoid taking sides in this dispute by turning their attention away from economic fluctuations and toward other topics \\nf0fs24 \\npardpardeftab720sl360sa240partightenfactor0\\n\\nbfs32 cf0 A New Synthesis or a Truce \\nb0fs24 \\npardpardeftab720sl360sa240partightenfactor0\\n\\nf1fs32 cf0 An old adage holds that science progresses funeral by funeral Today with the benefits of longer life expectancy it would be more accurate if less vivid to say that science progresses retirement by retirement In macroeconomics as the older generation of protagonists has retired or neared retirement it has been replaced by a younger generation of macroeconomists who have adopted a culture of greater civility At the same time a new consensus has emerged about the best way to understand economic fluctuations Marvin Goodfriend and Robert King 1997 have dubbed this consensus view 93the new neoclassical synthesis94 This synthesis model has been widely applied in research on monetary policy Clarida Gali and Gertler 1999 and McCallum and Nelson 1999 The most extensive treatment of this new synthesis is Michael Woodford92s 2003 monumental in both senses of the word treatise \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 13 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 Like the neoclassicalKeynesian synthesis of an earlier generation the new synthesis attempts to merge the strengths of the competing approaches that preceded it From the new classical models it takes the tools of dynamic stochastic general equilibrium theory Preferences constraints and optimization are the starting point and the analysis builds up from these microeconomic foundations From the new Keynesian models it takes nominal rigidities and uses them to explain why monetary policy has real effects in the short run The most common approach is to assume monopolistically competitive firms that change prices only intermittently resulting in price dynamics sometimes called the new Keynesian Phillips curve The heart of the synthesis is the view that the economy is a dynamic general equilibrium system that deviates from a Pareto optimum because of sticky prices and perhaps a variety of other market imperfections \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 It is tempting to describe the emergence of this consensus as great progress In some ways it is But there is also a less sanguine way to view the current the current state of play Perhaps what has occurred is not so much a synthesis as a truce between intellectual combatants followed by a facesaving retreat on both sides Both new classicals and new Keynesians can look to this new synthesis and claim a degree of victory while ignoring the more profound defeat that lies beneath the surface \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 The heart of this new synthesis97a dynamic general equilibrium system with nominal rigidities97 is precisely what one finds in the early Keynesian models Hicks proposed the ISLM model for example in an attempt at putting the ideas of Keynes into a general equilibrium setting Recall that Hicks won the 1972 Nobel Prize jointly with Kenneth Arrow for contributions to general equilibrium theory Klein Modigliani and the other modelbuilders were attempting to bring that general equilibrium system to the data to devise better policy To a large extent the new synthesis picks up the research agenda that the profession abandoned at the behest of the new classicals in the 1970s \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 With the benefit of hindsight it is clear that the new classical economists promised more than they could deliver Their stated aim was to discard Keynesian theorizing and replace it with marketclearing models that could be convincingly brought to the data and then used for policy analysis By that standard the movement failed Instead they helped to develop analytic tools that are now being used to develop another generation of models \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 14 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 that assume sticky prices and that in many ways resemble the models that the new classicals were campaigning against \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 The new Keynesians can claim a degree of vindication here The new synthesis discards the marketclearing assumption that Solow called 93foolishly restrictive94 and that the new Keynesian research on sticky prices aimed to undermine Yet the new Keynesians can be criticized for having taken the new classicals92 bait and as a result pursuing a research program that turned out to be too abstract and insufficiently practical Paul Krugman 2000 offers this evaluation of the new Keynesian research program 93One can now explain how price stickiness \\nf0i could \\nf1i0 happen But useful predictions about when it happens and when it does not or models that build from menu costs to a realistic Phillips curve just don92t seem to be forthcoming94 Even as a proponent of this line of work I have to admit that there is some truth to that assessment \\nf0fs24 \\npardpardeftab720sl360sa240partightenfactor0\\n\\nbfs32 cf0 The View from Central Banking \\nb0fs24 \\npardpardeftab720sl360sa240partightenfactor0\\n\\nf1fs32 cf0 If God put macroeconomists on earth to solve practical problems then Saint Peter will ultimately judge us by our contributions to economicengineering So let92s ask Have the developments in business cycle theory over the past several decades improved the making of economic policy Or to set a more modest goal have the advances in macroeconomic science altered how economic policy is analyzed and discussed among professional economists who are involved in the policy process \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 One place to find evidence to answer these questions is Laurence Meyer92s charming memoir \\nf0i A Term at the Fed\\nf1i0  In 1996 Meyer left his job as an economics professor at Washington University and as a prominent economic consultant to serve for six years as a governor of the Federal Reserve His book provides a window into how economists at the highest reaches of monetary policymaking view their jobs and the approaches they take to analyzing the economy \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 The book leaves the reader with one clear impression Recent developments in business cycle theory promulgated by both new classicals and new Keynesians have had close to zero impact on practical policymaking Meyer92s analysis of economic fluctuations and monetary policy is intelligent and nuanced but it shows no traces of modern macroeconomic theory It would seem almost completely familiar to someone who was \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 15 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 schooled in the neoclassicalKeynesian synthesis that prevailed around 1970 and has ignored the scholarly literature ever since Meyer92s worldview would be easy to dismiss as outdated if it were idiosyncratic but it92s not It is typical of economists who have held top positions in the world92s central banks \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 It is fashionable among academics to believe that central banking has been strongly influenced by the rulesvsdiscretion literature particularly the work on time inconsistency that started with Kydland and Prescott 1977 Two institutional changes are often linked with these academic contributions the increased independence of central banks in countries such as New Zealand and the adoption of inflation targeting as a policy regime in many central banks around the world These institutional changes in turn are then linked to improvements in monetary policy According to this line of argument we should thank Kydland and Prescott for the low stable inflation that many countries have enjoyed over the past two decades \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 This selfcongratulatory view runs into two problems The first is that the institutional changes we have observed are at best loosely connected to the issues raised in the theoretical literature An independent central bank is not the same as a rulebound central bank The US Federal Reserve has long had a high degree of independence without ever committing itself to a policy rule And even inflation targeting is closer to a statement of intentions and a way of communicating with the public than it is a commitment to a policy rule Ben Bernanke 2003 has called it 93constrained discretion94 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 The second more significant problem is that these institutional changes are not necessarily linked to the improvements we have witnessed in monetary policy Laurence Ball and Niamh Sheridan 2005 look at a large sample of countries and show that adoption of inflation targeting does not help explain the recent move toward low stable inflation Monetary policy has improved both in those counties that have adopted inflation targets and in those that have not This worldwide improvement in inflation outcomes could be because the world economy has not had to deal with supply shocks as adverse as those experienced in the 1970s or because central bankers have learned from the experience of the 1970s that high inflation should be assiduously avoided But the evidence shows that inflation targeting is not a prerequisite for good monetary policy \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 16 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 The Greenspan Fed is a case in point According to Alan Blinder and Ricardo Reis 2005 Alan Greenspan has a rightful claim to be 93the greatest central banker who ever lived94 Indeed by most accounts monetary policy worked remarkably well under his leadership Yet throughout his time at the helm of the Fed Greenspan avoided any announcement of a policy rule valuing flexibility over commitment Here is how Greenspan 2003 defended his choice 93Some critics have argued that such an approach to policy is too undisciplinedjudgmental seemingly discretionary and difficult to explain The Federal Reserve should some conclude attempt to be more formal in its operations by tying its actions solely to the prescriptions of a formal policy rule That any approach along these lines would lead to an improvement in economic performance however is highly doubtfulRules by their nature are simple and when significant and shifting uncertainties exist in the economic environment they cannot substitute for risk management paradigms which are far better suited to policymaking94 Yet despite Greenspan92s aversion to policy rules inflation was low and stable during his tenure as Fed chairman Greenspan proves contradicting Kydland and Prescott that central banks can produce desirable outcomes while wielding substantial discretionary powers \\nf0fs24 \\npardpardeftab720sl360sa240partightenfactor0\\n\\nbfs32 cf0 The View from Fiscal Policy \\nb0fs24 \\npardpardeftab720sl360sa240partightenfactor0\\n\\nf1fs32 cf0 Another place to look for the practical impact of macroeconomic theory is the analysis of fiscal policy The Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 offer a good case study in part because they are a recent attempt at major fiscal stimulus to combat a recession and in part because as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for two years I am familiar with much of the economic analysis that laid the foundation for this policy To be sure there were many motives for the design of the Bush tax policy The expansion of the child credit for example was rooted as much in politics and social philosophy as it was in economics But economists at the CEA and Treasury had substantial input into the development of the policy so it is illuminating to consider the tools they brought to the job \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 The economic analysis of the Bush tax plan was done with one eye on longrun growth and one eye on the shortrun business cycle The longrun perspective would be familiar to students of public finance Most significantly in 2003 Bush proposed eliminating the double taxation of income from corporate capital The final bill passed by \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 17 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 Congress did not fully achieve this goal but the substantial cut in tax rates on dividends moved in the direction of greater tax neutrality reducing the bias for retained earnings over dividends the bias for debt over equity finance and the bias for noncorporate over corporate capital It also moved the tax code further in the direction of taxing consumption rather than income This latter goal is consistent with a wellestablished literature in public finance for example Diamond and Mirrlees 1971 Atkinson and Stiglitz 1976 Feldstein 1978 Chamley 1986 and is not particularly new as a matter of economic theory Three decades ago Atkinson and Stiglitz noted even then there was a 93conventional presumption in favor of consumption rather than income taxation94 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 More relevant to this essay however is the shortrun analysis of tax policy As President George W Bush took office in 2001 the economy was heading into a recession after the bursting of the stock market bubble of the late 1990s One goal of the tax cuts was to stimulate economic recovery and employment When President Bush signed the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 he explained the policy as follows 93When people have more money they can spend it on goods and services And in our society when they demand an additional good or a service somebody will produce the good or a service And when somebody produces that good or a service it means somebody is more likely to be able to find a job94 This logic is quintessentially Keynesian \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 The Council of Economic Advisers was asked to quantify how tax relief would affect employment We answered this question using a mainstream macroeconometric model The specific model we used while I was there was the one maintained by Macroeconomic Advisers the consulting firm created and run by Laurence Meyer before he was a Fed governor This model was being used the CEA staff long before I arrived as chairman and in fact had been used for almost two decades under both Republican and Democratic administrations The choice of this particular model is not crucial however for the Macroeconomic Advisers model is similar to other large macroeconometric models such as the FRBUS model maintained by the Federal Reserve From the standpoint of intellectual history these models are the direct descendents of the early modeling efforts of Klein Modigliani and Eckstein Research by new classicals and new Keynesians has had minimal influence on the construction of these models \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 18 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 The real world of macroeconomic policymaking can be disheartening for those of us who have spent most of our careers in academia The sad truth is that the macroeconomic research of the past three decades has had only minor impact on the practical analysis of monetary or fiscal policy The explanation is not that economists in the policy arena are ignorant of recent developments Quite the contrary The staff of the Federal Reserve includes some of the best young PhD92s and the Council of Economic Advisers under both Democratic and Republican administrations draws talent from the nation92s top research universities The fact that modern macroeconomic research is not widely used in practical policymaking is \\nf0i prima facie \\nf1i0 evidence that it is of little use for this purpose The research may have been successful as a matter of science but it has not contributed significantly to macroeconomic engineering \\nf0fs24 \\npardpardeftab720sl360sa240partightenfactor0\\n\\nbfs32 cf0 Inside the Classroom \\nb0fs24 \\npardpardeftab720sl360sa240partightenfactor0\\n\\nf1fs32 cf0 Beyond the corridors of power in the world92s capitals there is another place where the economics profession tries to sell its wares to a broader audience97the undergraduate classroom Those of us who regularly teach undergraduates see our job as producing citizens who are well informed about the principles of good policy Our choice of material is guided by what we see as important for the next generation of voters to understand \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 Like policymakers undergraduates typically have little interest in theory for theory92s sake Instead they are interested in understanding how the real world works and how public policy can improve economic performance Except for the rare student who is considering graduate school and a career as an academic economist the undergraduate has the perspective of an engineer more than that of a scientist It is therefore useful to take note of what we choose to teach undergraduates And there is no better place to see what we teach than in the contents of the most widely used undergraduate textbooks \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 Consider for example the books used to teach intermediatelevel macroeconomics A generation ago the three leading texts for this course were those by Robert Gordon Robert Hall and John Taylor and Rudiger Dornbusch and Stanley Fischer Today the top three sellers are those written by Olivier Blanchard Andrew Abel and Ben Bernanke and myself The common thread is that each of these six books was written by at least one economist with graduate training from MIT a prominent engineering school where the \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 19 \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 dominant macroeconomic tradition was that of Samuelson and Solow In all these books the basic theory taught to undergraduates is some version of aggregate demand and aggregate supply and the basic theory of aggregate demand is the ISLM model The same lesson can be gleaned by perusing the most widely used textbooks for freshmanlevel economics Shortrun economic fluctuations are best understood using some version of the neoclassicalKeynesian synthesis \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 I do not mean to suggest that pedagogy has been stagnant as the field has evolved Today92s textbooks place greater emphasis on classical monetary theory models of longrun growth and the role of expectations than did those of thirty years ago There is less confidence about what policy can accomplish and more emphasis on policy rules over discretionary monetary and fiscal actions despite the lack of evidence on the practical importance of policy rules But the basic framework that modern students learn to make sense of the business cycle is one that would be familiar to an early generation of Keynesians \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 The exception that proves the rule is the intermediate text written by Robert Barro first published in 1984 Barro92s book provided a clear and accessible introduction to the new classical approach to macroeconomics aimed at undergraduates Keynesian models were included but they were covered late in the book briefly and with little emphasis When the book came out it received substantial attention and acclaim However while many macroeconomists read the Barro book and were impressed by it many fewer chose it for their students The new classical revolution in pedagogy that Barro hoped to inspire never took off and the Barro text did not offer significant competition to the dominant textbooks of the time \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 This lack of revolution in macroeconomic pedagogy stands in stark contrast to what occurred half a century ago When the Samuelson text was first published in 1948 with the aim of introducing undergraduates to the Keynesian revolution the world92s teachers rapidly and heartily embraced the new approach By contrast the ideas of new classicals and new Keynesians have not fundamentally changed how undergraduate macroeconomics is taught \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 20 \\nf0fs24 \\npardpardeftab720sl360sa240partightenfactor0\\n\\nbfs32 cf0 Not a Dentist in Sight \\nb0fs24 \\npardpardeftab720sl360sa240partightenfactor0\\n\\nf1fs32 cf0 John Maynard Keynes 1931 famously opined that 93If economists could manage to get themselves thought of as humble competent people on a level with dentists that would be splendid94 He was expressing a hope that the science of macroeconomics would evolve into a useful and routine type of engineering In this future utopia avoiding a recession would be as straightforward as filling a cavity \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 The leading developments in academic macroeconomics of the past several decades bear little resemblance to dentistry New classical and new Keynesian research has had little impact on practical macroeconomists who are charged with the messy task of conducting actual monetary and fiscal policy It has also had little impact on what teachers tell future voters about macroeconomic policy when they enter the undergraduate classroom From the standpoint of macroeconomic engineering the work of the past several decades looks like an unfortunate wrong turn \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 Yet from the more abstract perspective of macroeconomic science this work can be viewed more positively New classical economists were successful at showing the limitations of the large Keynesian macroeconometric models and the policy prescriptions based on these models They drew attention to the importance of expectations and the case for policy rules New Keynesian economists have supplied better models to explain why wages and prices fail to clear markets and more generally what types of market imperfections are needed to make sense of shortrun economic fluctuations The tension between these two visions while not always civil may have been productive for competition is as important to intellectual advance as it is to market outcomes \\nf0fs24 \\n\\nf1fs32 The resulting insights are being incorporated into the new synthesis that is now developing and which will eventually become the foundation for the next generation of macroeconometric models For those of us interested in macroeconomics as both science and engineering we can take the recent emergence of a new synthesis as a hopeful sign that more progress can be made on both fronts As we look ahead humble and competent remain ideals toward which macroeconomists can aspire '"
