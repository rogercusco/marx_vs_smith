jeopQ <- "This paper develops a simple model that shows how a country can endogenously become differentiated into an industrialized "core" and an agricultural "periphery." In order to realize scale economies while minimizing transport costs, manufacturing firms tend to locate in the region with larger demand, but the location of demand itself depends on the distribution of manufacturing. Emergence of a core-periphery pattern depends on transportation costs, economies of scale, and the share of manufacturing in national income.
The study of economic geography-of the location of factors of pro- duction in space-occupies a relatively small part of standard eco- nomic analysis. International trade theory, in particular, convention- ally treats nations as dimensionless points (and frequently assumes zero transportation costs between countries as well). Admittedly, models descended from von Thunen (1826) play an important role in urban studies, while Hotelling-type models of locational competi- tion get a reasonable degree of attention in industrial organization. On the whole, however, it seems fair to say that the study of economic geography plays at best a marginal role in economic theory.
On the face of it, this neglect is surprising. The facts of economic geography are surely among the most striking features of real-world economies, at least to laymen. For example, one of the most remark- able things about the United States is that in a generally sparsely populated country, much of whose land is fertile, the bulk of the population resides in a few clusters of metropolitan areas; a quarter of the inhabitants are crowded into a not especially inviting section of the East Coast. It has often been noted that nighttime satellite
photos of Europe reveal little of political boundaries but clearly sug- gest a center-periphery pattern whose hub is somewhere in or near Belgium. A layman might have expected that these facts would play a key role in economic modeling. Yet the study of economic geogra- phy, at least within the economics profession, has lain largely dormant for the past generation (with a few notable exceptions, particularly Arthur [1989, 1990] and David [in press]).
The purpose of this paper is to suggest that application of models and techniques derived from theoretical industrial organization now allows a reconsideration of economic geography, that it is now time to attempt to incorporate the insights of the long but informal tradi- tion in this area into formal models. In order to make the point, the paper develops a simple illustrative model designed to shed light on one of the key questions of location: Why and when does manufactur- ing become concentrated in a few regions, leaving others relatively undeveloped?
What we shall see is that it is possible to develop a very simple model of geographical concentration of manufacturing based on the interaction of economies of scale with transportation costs. This is perhaps not too surprising, given the kinds of results that have been emerging in recent literature (with Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny [1989a, 1989b] perhaps the closest parallel). More interesting is the fact that this concentration of manufacturing in one location need not always happen and that whether it does depends in an interesting way on a few key parameters.
The paper is divided into four sections. Section I sets the stage with an informal discussion of the problem. Section II then sets out the analytical model. In Section III, I analyze the determination of short- run equilibrium and dynamics. Section IV analyzes the conditions under which concentration of manufacturing production does and does not occur.
I. Bases for Regional Divergence
There has been fairly extensive discussion over time of the nature of the externalities that lead to localization of particular industries. Indeed, Alfred Marshall's original exposition of the concept of exter- nal economies was illustrated with the example of industry localiza- tion. Most of the literature in this area follows Marshall in identifying three reasons for localization. First, the concentration of several firms in a single location offers a pooled market for workers with industry- specific skills, ensuring both a lower probability of unemployment and a lower probability of labor shortage. Second, localized industries can support the production of nontradable specialized inputs. Third,
informational spillovers can give clustered firms a better production function than isolated producers. (Hoover [1948] gives a particularly clear discussion of agglomeration economies.)
These accounts of industry localization surely have considerable validity. In this paper, however, I shall offer a somewhat different approach aimed at answering a somewhat different question. Instead of asking why a particular industry is concentrated in a particular area-for example, carpets in Dalton, Georgia-I shall ask why man- ufacturing in general might end up concentrated in one or a few regions of a country, with the remaining regions playing the "periph- eral" role of agricultural suppliers to the manufacturing "core." The proposed explanation correspondingly focuses on generalized exter- nal economies rather than those specific to a particular industry.
I shall also adopt the working assumption that the externalities that sometimes lead to emergence of a core-periphery pattern are pecuniaryexternalities associated with either demand or supply link- ages rather than purely technological spillovers. In competitive gen- eral equilibrium, of course, pecuniary externalities have no welfare significance and could not lead to the kind of interesting dynamics
we shall derive later. Over the past decade, however, it has become a familiar point that in the presence of imperfect competition and increasing returns, pecuniary externalities matter; for example, if one firm's actions affect the demand for the product of another firm whose price exceeds marginal cost, this is as much a "real"externality as if one firm's research and development spills over into the general knowledge pool. At the same time, by focusing on pecuniary external- ities, we are able to make the analysis much more concrete than if we allowed external economies to arise in some invisible form. (This is particularly true when location is at issue: how far does a technologi- cal spillover spill?)
To understand the nature of the postulated pecuniary externalities, imagine a country in which there are two kinds of production, agri- culture and manufacturing. Agricultural production is characterized both by constant returns to scale and by intensive use of immobile land. The geographical distribution of this production will therefore be determined largely by the exogenous distribution of suitable land. Manufactures, on the other hand, we may suppose to be character- ized by increasing returns to scale and modest use of land.
Where will manufactures production take place? Because of econo- mies of scale, production of each manufactured good will take place at only a limited number of sites. Other things equal, the preferred sites will be those with relatively large nearby demand, since produc- ing near one's main market minimizes transportation costs. Other locations will then be served from these centrally located sites.
But where will demand be large? Some of the demand for manu- factured goods will come from the agricultural sector; if that were the whole story, the distribution of manufacturing production would essentially form a lattice whose form was dictated by the distribution of agricultural land, as in the classic schemes of Christaller (1933) and Losch (1940). But it is not the whole story: some of the demand for manufactures will come not from the agricultural sector but from the manufacturing sector itself.
This creates an obvious possibility for what Myrdal (1957) called "circular causation" and Arthur (1990) has called "positive feedback": manufactures production will tend to concentrate where there is a large market, but the market will be large where manufactures pro- duction is concentrated.
The circularity created by this Hirschman (1958)-type "backward linkage" may be reinforced by a "forward linkage": other things equal, it will be more desirable to live and produce near a concentra- tion of manufacturing production because it will then be less expen- sive to buy the goods this central place provides.
This is not an original story; indeed, a story along roughly these lines has long been familiar to economic geographers, who emphasize the role of circular processes in the emergence of the U.S. manufac- turing belt in the second half of the nineteenth century (see in partic- ular Pred [1966] and Meyer [1983]). The main goal of this paper is to show that this story can be embodied in a simple yet rigorous model. However, before we move on to this model, it may be worth pursuing the intuitive story a little further to ask two questions: How far will the tendency toward geographical concentration proceed, and where will manufacturing production actually end up?
The answer to the first question is that it depends on the underlying parameters of the economy. The circularity that can generate manu- facturing concentration will not matter too much if manufacturing employs only a small fraction of the population and hence generates only a small fraction of demand, or if a combination of weak econo- mies of scale and high transportation costs induces suppliers of goods and services to the agricultural sector to locate very close to their markets. These criteria would have been satisfied in a prerailroad, preindustrial society, such as that of early nineteenth-century America. In such a society the bulk of the population would have been engaged in agriculture, the small manufacturing and commer- cial sector would not have been marked by very substantial economies of scale, and the costs of transportation would have ensured that most of the needs that could not be satisfied by rural production would be satisfied by small towns serving local market areas.

Some of the demand for manu- factured goods will come from the agricultural sector; if that were the whole story, the distribution of manufacturing production would essentially form a lattice whose form was dictated by the distribution of agricultural land, as in the classic schemes of Christaller (1933) and Losch (1940). But it is not the whole story: some of the demand for manufactures will come not from the agricultural sector but from the manufacturing sector itself.
This creates an obvious possibility for what Myrdal (1957) called and Arthur (1990) has called : manufactures production will tend to concentrate where there is a large market, but the market will be large where manufactures pro- duction is concentrated.
The circularity created by this Hirschman (1958)-type may be reinforced by a : other things equal, it will be more desirable to live and produce near a concentra- tion of manufacturing production because it will then be less expen- sive to buy the goods this central place provides.
This is not an original story; indeed, a story along roughly these lines has long been familiar to economic geographers, who emphasize the role of circular processes in the emergence of the U.S. manufac- turing belt in the second half of the nineteenth century (see in partic- ular Pred [1966] and Meyer [1983]). The main goal of this paper is to show that this story can be embodied in a simple yet rigorous model. However, before we move on to this model, it may be worth pursuing the intuitive story a little further to ask two questions: How far will the tendency toward geographical concentration proceed, and where will manufacturing production actually end up?
The answer to the first question is that it depends on the underlying parameters of the economy. The circularity that can generate manu- facturing concentration will not matter too much if manufacturing employs only a small fraction of the population and hence generates only a small fraction of demand, or if a combination of weak econo- mies of scale and high transportation costs induces suppliers of goods and services to the agricultural sector to locate very close to their markets. These criteria would have been satisfied in a prerailroad, preindustrial society, such as that of early nineteenth-century America. In such a society the bulk of the population would have been engaged in agriculture, the small manufacturing and commer- cial sector would not have been marked by very substantial economies of scale, and the costs of transportation would have ensured that most of the needs that could not be satisfied by rural production would be satisfied by small towns serving local market areas.

jeopQ <- "This paper develops a simple model that shows how a country can endogenously become differentiated into an industrialized core and an agricultural periphery. In order to realize scale economies while minimizing transport costs, manufacturing firms tend to locate in the region with larger demand, but the location of demand itself depends on the distribution of manufacturing. Emergence of a core-periphery pattern depends on transportation costs, economies of scale, and the share of manufacturing in national income.
The study of economic geography-of the location of factors of pro- duction in space-occupies a relatively small part of standard eco- nomic analysis. International trade theory, in particular, convention- ally treats nations as dimensionless points (and frequently assumes zero transportation costs between countries as well). Admittedly, models descended from von Thunen (1826) play an important role in urban studies, while Hotelling-type models of locational competi- tion get a reasonable degree of attention in industrial organization. On the whole, however, it seems fair to say that the study of economic geography plays at best a marginal role in economic theory.
On the face of it, this neglect is surprising. The facts of economic geography are surely among the most striking features of real-world economies, at least to laymen. For example, one of the most remark- able things about the United States is that in a generally sparsely populated country, much of whose land is fertile, the bulk of the population resides in a few clusters of metropolitan areas; a quarter of the inhabitants are crowded into a not especially inviting section of the East Coast. It has often been noted that nighttime satellite
photos of Europe reveal little of political boundaries but clearly sug- gest a center-periphery pattern whose hub is somewhere in or near Belgium. A layman might have expected that these facts would play a key role in economic modeling. Yet the study of economic geogra- phy, at least within the economics profession, has lain largely dormant for the past generation (with a few notable exceptions, particularly Arthur [1989, 1990] and David [in press]).
The purpose of this paper is to suggest that application of models and techniques derived from theoretical industrial organization now allows a reconsideration of economic geography, that it is now time to attempt to incorporate the insights of the long but informal tradi- tion in this area into formal models. In order to make the point, the paper develops a simple illustrative model designed to shed light on one of the key questions of location: Why and when does manufactur- ing become concentrated in a few regions, leaving others relatively undeveloped?
What we shall see is that it is possible to develop a very simple model of geographical concentration of manufacturing based on the interaction of economies of scale with transportation costs. This is perhaps not too surprising, given the kinds of results that have been emerging in recent literature (with Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny [1989a, 1989b] perhaps the closest parallel). More interesting is the fact that this concentration of manufacturing in one location need not always happen and that whether it does depends in an interesting way on a few key parameters.
The paper is divided into four sections. Section I sets the stage with an informal discussion of the problem. Section II then sets out the analytical model. In Section III, I analyze the determination of short- run equilibrium and dynamics. Section IV analyzes the conditions under which concentration of manufacturing production does and does not occur.
I. Bases for Regional Divergence
There has been fairly extensive discussion over time of the nature of the externalities that lead to localization of particular industries. Indeed, Alfred Marshall's original exposition of the concept of exter- nal economies was illustrated with the example of industry localiza- tion. Most of the literature in this area follows Marshall in identifying three reasons for localization. First, the concentration of several firms in a single location offers a pooled market for workers with industry- specific skills, ensuring both a lower probability of unemployment and a lower probability of labor shortage. Second, localized industries can support the production of nontradable specialized inputs. Third,
informational spillovers can give clustered firms a better production function than isolated producers. (Hoover [1948] gives a particularly clear discussion of agglomeration economies.)
These accounts of industry localization surely have considerable validity. In this paper, however, I shall offer a somewhat different approach aimed at answering a somewhat different question. Instead of asking why a particular industry is concentrated in a particular area-for example, carpets in Dalton, Georgia-I shall ask why man- ufacturing in general might end up concentrated in one or a few regions of a country, with the remaining regions playing the  role of agricultural suppliers to the manufacturing The proposed explanation correspondingly focuses on generalized exter- nal economies rather than those specific to a particular industry.
I shall also adopt the working assumption that the externalities that sometimes lead to emergence of a core-periphery pattern are pecuniaryexternalities associated with either demand or supply link- ages rather than purely technological spillovers. In competitive gen- eral equilibrium, of course, pecuniary externalities have no welfare significance and could not lead to the kind of interesting dynamics
we shall derive later. Over the past decade, however, it has become a familiar point that in the presence of imperfect competition and increasing returns, pecuniary externalities matter; for example, if one firm's actions affect the demand for the product of another firm whose price exceeds marginal cost, this is as much a externality as if one firm's research and development spills over into the general knowledge pool. At the same time, by focusing on pecuniary external- ities, we are able to make the analysis much more concrete than if we allowed external economies to arise in some invisible form. (This is particularly true when location is at issue: how far does a technologi- cal spillover spill?)
To understand the nature of the postulated pecuniary externalities, imagine a country in which there are two kinds of production, agri- culture and manufacturing. Agricultural production is characterized both by constant returns to scale and by intensive use of immobile land. The geographical distribution of this production will therefore be determined largely by the exogenous distribution of suitable land. Manufactures, on the other hand, we may suppose to be character- ized by increasing returns to scale and modest use of land.
Where will manufactures production take place? Because of econo- mies of scale, production of each manufactured good will take place at only a limited number of sites. Other things equal, the preferred sites will be those with relatively large nearby demand, since produc- ing near one's main market minimizes transportation costs. Other locations will then be served from these centrally located sites.
But where will demand be large? Some of the demand for manu- factured goods will come from the agricultural sector; if that were the whole story, the distribution of manufacturing production would essentially form a lattice whose form was dictated by the distribution of agricultural land, as in the classic schemes of Christaller (1933) and Losch (1940).
